\emph{Pale Blue Valley} is the story of a love-triangle in no specific
place or time.  Its narrative unfolds against a background of
political unrest between a dominant ruling entity and a resentfully
Balad minority who once lived in a place known as Pale Blue
Valley. This unrest finds expression in acts of terror organized by
the Balads, which in turn provoke harsh military repression.

Aera and Yamik are a young Balad couple. Yamik is a member of his
people's underground Freedom Fighters. Glin, who belongs with the
prevailing dominant entity, is totally immersed in the world of
music. A clandestine love affair blossoms between him and Aera.

Glin and Yamik happen to make each other's acquaintance, neither
having an inkling of Aera's connection with the other.

Aera is torn between the two. Her inner struggle is exacerbated when
the men's acquaintanceship turns into a warm friendship.

Glin and Yamik's friendship turns into a strong bond. The elevated
ideals of the Balads evoke in Glin the wonders of music. He readily
joins Yamik in his terrorist activities.

Aera becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a baby whose paternity she
is unsure of. Each one of the men believes the baby to be his.

Pale Blue Valley is a story of love, friendship, idealism, acts of
terror, periods of political calm, fluctuations between hope and despair.
