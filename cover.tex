\emph{Pale Blue Valley} is the story of a love-triangle in an unnamed
country. The plot unfolds against a background of political unrest
between the dominant ruling entity and a resentfully Balad minority
who once lived in a place known as Pale Blue Valley. This unrest finds
expression in acts of terror organized by the Balads, which in turn
provoke harsh military repression.

Aera and Yamik are a young Balad couple. Yamik is a member of his
people's underground Freedom Fighters. Glin, who belongs with the
prevailing dominant entity, is totally immersed in the world of
music. A clandestine love affair blossoms between him and Aera.

Glin and Yamik happen to make each other's acquaintance, neither
\hbox{having} an inkling of Aera's connection with the other.

Aera is torn between the two. Her inner struggle is intensified when
the men's acquaintanceship turns into a warm friendship.

Glin and Yamik's friendship turns into a strong bond. The elevated
ideals of the Balads evoke in Glin the wonders of music. He readily
joins Yamik in his terrorist activities.

Aera becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a baby whose paternity is
ambiguous to her. Each one of the men believes the baby to be his.

\emph{Pale Blue Valley} is a story of love, friendship, idealism, acts of
terror, periods of political calm, hope and despair.
