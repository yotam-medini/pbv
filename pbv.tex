Sincere thanks to Mary Vaadia who was the first to go over my draft
for the English translation of the Hebrew book ``\emph{Balada La'teror}''
published in 2000 by G'vanim Publishing House.

\bigskip
No less am I indebted to Valerie Arnon for her insightful redaction of
the English translation. Her sensitivity with words and uncluttered
style contribute significantly to the novel's directness and flow.

\bigskip
Last but not least I would like to note with deep~appreciation the
readiness of my granddaughter Amalia Medini to look over scores of
imperfect phrases and smooth them out.

\chapter{}

`Here I go again,
my love,{ saying that you haven't changed. Not one little
bit}. {Time after time I've said it. I'll say it
till the end of days. Yes, Saffia Saffia, my~darling. First and last name the same. }They used to call you Double
Saffia --- make a joke of it.{ No,
you} {haven't
changed }at all, my dearest, which is something you can't say about
me --- your
eternal{ widow. I keep growing older. Older and older.
}Today{ you wouldn't recognize me. This is what happened to our
severed~life.'}

Rimat speaks these words voicelessly, gazing at the faded photo, then kissing it.
It doesn't do Saffia
justice because Boni took it just as he was getting up --- face
puffy, hair disheveled,
eyes unfocused. But this is the only photo that survived the
disaster. How close were those two brothers --- ``Big-Saff{}''
and ``Li'l-Saff''.

S{he hangs onto the photo till she hears Glin's footsteps in the
evening quiet. When }they get louder {it's time to return the photo
to its hiding place under the old cradle's mattress. She tugs at a corner of
the}{ }cloth lying on top of the
mattress{ looking for where she left off. The yellow flower is almost
complete. How many more flowers will she need} {to complete the
garland? Five, she }thinks{, maybe six. Afterwards she'll embroider
another }ring, p{erhaps even a third.
}How{ will this piece of embroidery
end }up?{ }A{
table{}-cloth,} a {bedspread --- who knows? She can't remember when
she began working on }it, nor does she know if she'll {ever finish
it. Who cares? }The days when she measured the passing of time by days, weeks, months, seasons, years,  are long
gone.

{Outside Glin }mounts the
stairs {two at a time and bursts into the room, Walkman dangling on
his chest, earphones~}slung{ around his neck. He lays a few discs on
the table, swiftly crosses the room and opens the window.~ A women's lament drifts in from the rosy twilight.}

{ {}``}Hi,{
Glin,'' says Rimat, ``it's cold outside ---''}

``And if I{ close the window{\ldots}?''}

{}``No, it won't be warm outside ---''

{{}``Ha-ha-ha!'' Glin }forces a
laugh. ``Hi, mom ---'' 

{{}``And while you're at it, }would you be good enough to switch on
the light. {It's getting dark.{}''}

``One thing at a time, if~you don't
mind{,'' says Glin. He closes the window and presses his face against
the glass}.{ ``Who are those
}two{ }{women singing out
there?''}

{{}``The two Balad women, I
}expect{,'' Rimat answers.}

{}``What Balad women?''

``The ones who started working{ in the village.''

{``Come to think of it, I've never met a Balad --- man,
woman }or child.''

{{}``They came looking for work. Jobs were arranged for them in the
packing }shed{.''}

{}``Gidal had a hand in it, no doubt ---''

{~``}I expect
so{,''~Rimat says. }

``You
don't expect, mom.
You know.'' Glin regrets having said
this because it annoyed his  mom, but it slipped from his tongue.
``D'you know them?''

{}``Only from afar.''

{}``So where are they heading~now?''

{{}``They live in that shack up the
hill, }past{ the bend.''}

{{}``In that hovel?'' Glin turns }to his
mom{.}

{Only now does Rimat notice~a new
B}and-Aid {on his right temple. She doesn't ask about it. T}hat would
only rub him the wrong way{. ``It's been fixed up,{}'' she emphasizes
as she explains. }

{That too is Gidal's doing, Glin is certain. Not wishing to annoy his
}mom{ again he keeps quiet. She has a soft spot for Golden Hands. Let
the }old boy {enjoy it.}

{Rimat bends over the old cradle, her fingers searching for the
}skein {of embroidery thread under the soft mound of cloth. She
pulls }out some {white thread and examines it against the white
cloth. ``Should I use white in the }empty{ spaces? White on white?''}

{{}``Void on void.{}'' Glin
}turns{ back to the window and opens it again. Meanwhile the twilight
has deepened and the gloomy melody filters in from~a distance. ``Mom, come see how beautiful they look against the
sunset ---''}

{Rimat leaves off her embroidery, gets up with a sigh and goes over to
the window. ``A picture postcard,'' she says. The singing momentarily gives way to a tinkle of silvery laughter. ``I
think they're~mother and~daughter}. Would you mind shutting this window for the
night?{{}''
}Returning{ }{to her armchair
she turns on the light, }then trails her fingers {against the violin
case on }top of{ }{the
bookcase. She collects the fresh crop of flakes that the cover has recently shed and
}puts{ them in her pocket. Later on},~in the
darkness, {she'll let them fall from her hands into the trash
bin }outside{. She'll do it slowly, deliberately.~She eases herself
back into her chair and threads her needle with red thread. Up and down, up and down }through the white calico she
{plies her needle.  ``If it
isn't}{ }{too much to
ask,'' she }turns to her son, {``could you
}draw the curtains close? The sun's going down.{ You know I don't like
to see the dark} {outside.'' }

{Not only does Glin
}ignore{ her bidding, but he again turns off the light. ``The light
inside~o}bscures {the dark outside,{}'' he says returning to the
window. ``Did you hear what I said? I
repeat}{:}{ The light inside
}obscures{ the dark outside. You're not impressed by the symbolism
resonating in these words. With all due respect, }dear mom, {you do
lack poetic sensibility. My `void on void' }before also left you
unimpressed.{ Where are their men?
}Making{~those bombs?''}

Rimat's scissors slip from her knees to the floor with a loud clang. How can her son mention those horrific bombs so
lightly? It's her own fault. She didn't do enough to make him hate the idea of bloodshed.

``The~guard's closing the gate,{}'' says Glin drawing the curtains close. {}``He's limping. That means
it's Moshko. The clang of~your~scissors was the overture to the clang of the gate. A prelude. So those Balad women
work in the packing shed,{}'' Glin commits this piece of information to memory. ``You're a~well of
knowledge.''

``What will happen to you when I'm gone?''

``That won't necessarily happen. Death doesn't always go by seniority --- father, mother, child.'' Glin regrets his
flippancy. He's gone too far. Although he cannot truly grieve for a father he doesn't remember, he's deeply
conscious of his mom's everlasting mourning for her love ---  victim of a heart attack snatched from life at its
most dynamic. He steals a glance at her. He's already been forgiven.

{Rimat doesn't always understand her son's~humor. Saffia, too, used to
say that a keen sense of humor wasn't exactly her forte. }He forgave her this deficiency just as he forgave her for
others far worse. But she will never forgive his friends nor his brother Boni for having left~him to his tragic fate.
Nor will she ever forgive herself.~ She should have trusted her gut and begged him not to leave the house carrying
those damned bombs. She should've shrieked to high heaven, laid herself on the doorstep to stop him. Instead,
she'd~yielded to fatigue. Nursing Glin, pacing the floor with him those sleepless nights --- she was exhausted. When
the final hour comes, is this the way she'll close her eyes with anger still smoldering inside? A thought crosses
her mind --- maybe now is the time to learn from Saffia the art of forgiveness. If she can ever forgive his brother
and{ his friends, she might be able to forgive herself too. }

Glin asks, ``How long have they been working in the village?''

{}``Almost a week.''

{}``It's the first time I've seen them here ---''

{{}``}At first{ they
were told to use the new gate, but this morning they began opening the old gate for them.'' }

{{}``Why}{ }{the
change?'' }

``You're a genius if you can't figure that out yourself. The new gate made them go a long way
round through the village and that took time.  Using this old gate makes it a short walk. And
you have to remember that they are after all Balads. Not everybody's happy about
that.''

``Why do people care? Anyhow, is this
also {thanks
to }Golden Hands?''

``Probably.''

Suddenly something~from outside shatters the window and hits Glin on
the cheek.

{}``Glin!'' Rimat rushes to her son and tries to stem the bleeding
with a handkerchief.

{{}``The daily gift,'' says Glin. ``If you hadn't
insisted }that {I close the window, I would have gotten only a
}little tap{.'' }

{{}``Press hard with }that
handkerchief,{{}'' Rimat advises as she hurries to get
a}{ }Band-Aid.

Glin bends down to pick up the muddy
package from the floor. Opening it he reads the attached note aloud:
``{\thinspace}`Every bullet has its address.' How very
original.''

{Rimat returns, dabs iodine on the cut and }applies the
dressing{. }

Glin --- his face now adorned with two strips
puts }a closed
fist {to his mouth. }{}``Tarrum-tarrum-tarrum!{}'' he trumpets. ``On
the one hand, mom,{ this isn't one of your annual springtime
letters from your old friend that}{ }{history
professor. But on the other hand ---'' he pulls a folded scrap of paper from his pocket and hands it
to }her,{ ``it sure is interesting!{}'' }

Rimat flattens the scrap of paper. ``Alir!'' she cries out.

{}``Your old poet-friend, indeed ---''

{}``It's his picture from the old days,{}'' Rimat says. Scanning the
text underneath she purses her lips. ``Where did you find this?{}''

``On the path coming home.''

Those Balad women may have dropped it accidentally or maybe on purpose, Rimat thinks to
herself{. }

``Your stories about Alir made me imagine him as a
saintly soul hovering up above,'' Glin continues, ``and here he's so down to earth. But the
main thing is his poetic device.'' Glin is about to quote from memory beginning with the poem's title, ``Next To ---''


{{}``Stop!'' Rimat }shuts him
up{. She can't bear to hear the terrible words. What happened to
Alir? --- she asks herself --- Alir, who wouldn't~hurt a fly?}

{Glin }resents her intervention. All he wanted to do
was{ explain how overwhelmed he was by the third and last line --- how
its deviation from the poem's initial structure sharpened its meaning. Instead he says: {}``The way he used to say
that in a moment he'd commit to memory the poem }he'd conceived in his mind and heart
{and then jot it down in his notebook ---'' }

{}``You remember my stories.''

``That's such an original way of putting it.''

{Rimat doesn't tell him that when a moment of inspiration~came over
Alir,~Saffia~would neither sing nor play his violin --- the moment was too precious. Those~unforgettable times,
living from hand to mouth in that hole-in-the-wall. But Saffia insisted that you don't abandon a friend to
homelessness. So} he'd invited Alir to move in with his brother Boni into the glass veranda, beds foot to
foot. Glin doesn't even know of his uncle Boni's existence --- formally known as Bonimi --- whose life has not ground
to a halt. Golden-Hands Gidal whose veins flow with the milk of human kindness,~who reads the papers, listens to the
radio and watches television, shares with her bits and pieces he gleans about their old friends. It's thanks to him she
knows that Boni has become Chief Executive Officer of the Public Television Network --- whatever that means. Not to
mention the fact that she has no TV. But~thanks to Gidal too she knows about the calamity that befell Zakod, and about
Michlor who went abroad to pursue his medical career and became a world-famous pediatrician. Gidal attributes the
absence of any mention of Shouba on the media to his being an applied chemist. And Alir's absence from the media? Well,
how many poets enjoy the limelight? She returns the disturbing scr{ap
of paper to Glin and takes up her embroidery.}

{After folding the
}note{ }{and putting it back
in his pocket Glin dons his earphones and turns on the Walkman. }

``No!!!'' Rimat stops her ears.

Glin quickly
switches {it off. ``Sorry, mom.'' }He comes over to pat her greying
hair.~ When he reaches her age his hair too will be grey.~ His father died~before a single hair of his turned white ---
that's what his mom told him.  She also told him that{ }his father was dashingly handsome and had an
aura of grace about him, that his speaking voice was mellifluous, that he had a lovely tenor singing voice, that from
the violin~he had saved up every penny to buy he produced divine music. Glin knows~that
{he didn't inherit any of his father's traits except perhaps the
love of music. No, not love.~Passion. He }presses {a button on the
Walkman and }music soon has him under its spell.

\chapter{}

{Aera sits on the wooden bench
out}side{. }It's getting darker.
Soon{ Yamik will completely disappear into~the trunk~of the tree he's
leaning against. Maybe he's fallen asleep standing. When he }arrived he'd hugged her and Mother, kissed them both
and then fell silent. He looks tired out. Who knows what he went through till he got here. Who knows what lies ahead of
him when he leaves.

Mother emerges from the shack with a loaded tray. {{}``Eat, my hungry
son, drink, my thirsty son,'' she urges her
}{nephew}{, ``you must've been on the road for
hours.''}

{{}``Many thanks, auntie,'' Yamik says,
``but you`re overdoing it. I'm not hungry }and
not {thirsty.''}

``Because of what's on your mind,'' Mother sympathizes, seating herself on the doorstep. ``Even as a child you
didn't feel hunger or thirst when you had something on your mind.''~ She's afraid it's not only~Balad matters that
Yamik has on his mind. She fears something has come between Aera and Yamik. If her intuition is right --- how dreadful!
She can't stop thinking about what she'd witnessed --- the way Aera looked when she chatted with that
skinny{ }young fellow from the village as the two of them stood outside the packing shed. Aera's
hands~hung loosely at her sides, but her twitching fingers gave her away.~ She knows~her daughter like the palm of her
hand.~ Once again she turns to Yamik, ``Tell us something. Only what's fit for our ears, of course.{}'' Then she asks
in a whisper as if alluding to some mysterious vision, ``Did you get to the Valley?''

{}``Not yet, auntie,'' says Yamik. ``It's not easy for us Balads to get there. But I will. As shall we all.''

{}``These words heal my wounded soul ---'' she sighs.

Only in her imagination, Aera knows, can she remove Yamik from her life. But for the moment she must put that aside.
Pertinent issues have to be settled now between the two of them. ``Mother dear,'' she says, ``bed time.''

{}``Since when does a daughter tell her mother it's bed time?''  Mother remonstrates.

Aera has her riposte ready, ``Ever since~wisdom passed from one generation to the next. It's late, Mother.''

Ignoring her, Mother turns to Yamik. {}``Wouldn't you like some coffee, my son?''

``Yamik will tell me when he wants coffee,'' her daughter insists, ``I too can make
coffee.''

{}``I blend special spices in the coffee,'' argues Mother.

Aera gets the point. Her wise Mother has sensed that something has come between her and Yamik. That's why she wants to
keep them from being alone together.

{}``Maybe \textit{you} should be the one to make yourself scarce,'' Mother adds stubbornly. ``I have things to say to my
nephew, to my daughter's husband who is like a son to me, and they aren't meant for your ears.''

{}``Like what, Mother dear?''

{}``About that skinny{ }lad from their village, for example ---''

Aera releases a tinkle of laughter. ~``About that skinny lad from their village, for example, I shall~tell Yamik
myself. That story is mine.'' How lucky the allusion to Glin came from Mother. She's relieved. She feels Glin all
around her.

Mother says, ``Time was when my daughter was mine.''

 ``Time was when my Mother was mine,{}'' Aera responds.

``God bless you, my son,'' Mother kisses Yamik on the forehead and disappears indoors.

``I didn't say, `Time was when my wife was mine','' Yamik remarks.

Aera doesn't quite know what to make of Yamik's words.
``Well, now you did ---'' she retorts expecting that the business at hand is about to~be broached.

{}``Aera, you haven't done it yet.''

Aera stares through Yamik into the dark hill behind.

Yamik adds, {}``Don't put it off. I told you what'll happen to me if you don't do it. And soon.''

Mother's voice is heard from the shack, ``Daughter, listen to your~man.''

``This is between the two of us!'' Aera calls back.

{}``Where's your father?'' ~Mother doesn't let up. ``Where{ }are your
brothers and sisters?''

Neither does Aera let up, ``Mother, \textit{go to sleep.}{}''

{}``Too much thinking is no good,'' Yamik tells his wife softly. ``It makes the actual doing
even harder. It also increases fear. Are you afraid?''

{}``No,'' says Aera, but she hasn't the courage to tell him that fear has become secondary. What concerns her most now
is that she has ceased to feel at one with her assignment. She makes a suggestion, ``How about you separating from the
men?  Then you'd be free to do things on your own ---''

{}``This is silly girl's talk,'' once again Mother's voice comes over. ``How much strength
does one person have on his own?''

``Mother,'' Yamik pleads, directing his voice to the shack, ``good night.''

{}``There are people who can do things by themselves, but I'm not one of
them,{}'' Yamik{ }confesses to Aera who has to admire his candor and
modesty. {}``The guard won't see that you're coming back,{}'' he goes on, ``because it'll be pitch dark. To-night,
when I leave, I'll dig a bit deeper there. You'll have plenty of room to slide through there and back.''

Aera's heart skips a beat. Yamik will not stay the night!

Yamik feels that Aera needs some more encouragement, ``Let's go over the instructions again.''

{}``I know them by heart,'' she says.

``There can never be enough of going over instructions,'' he insists.
\linebreak[4]
``Mother and you go
out through the gate while the guard is busy with the lock. Mother keeps singing. You pick up those dry twigs that
you've already tied together and slide back under the fence. The guard starts walking away slowly. You said he limps.
You wait patiently until he's very close to that iron peg protruding from the ground. That's critical. To wait
patiently and not to act too soon. And then ---  only then --- one strong push! Then you walk backwards to the fence,
continuing to sweep over your tracks using those dry twigs like a broom. You
then slide outside. That's it. Done. They'll think that he tripped because
of his limp.''

{}``And if he yells?''

{}``At most he'll cry out only once. Do it well and there won't be any problems.''

{}``And if there are?''

``There won't be.'' Yamik remembers the instructions he was given for \textit{his} first assignment.
How encouraged he was by the rugged determination of the experienced older man who gave them. ``And now, what's that
about that skinny lad from their village?''

{}``I'll make you some coffee and tell you,{}'' she says, moving towards the doorway. Yamik's question has~wiped away
Glin's {imminence}. Passing by him she carefully dodges his hand, but his voice pursues her.

{}``Do you know how to blend in Mother's secret spices?''

She transfers this question to Glin's lips and can't contain her silvery laughter. She knows Yamik loves that. He's
always telling her that it's how his aunt used to laugh ---  for she'd adopted him when he was a small baby some
time before Aera was born. But when Mother herself was struck by disaster she stopped laughing. Since then she has
worn only black. That too. He moves away from the tree-trunk and sits down next to the tray. Now the food begins to
whet his appetite.

Aera reappears carrying a coffee pot in one~hand and a~cup in the other. She fills the cup and hands it to Yamik. ``I
blended in mother's~secret spices,'' she smiles.

Yamik eats and drinks with relish. ``Why don't you eat too?'' he asks.

{}``I ate before you came.''

{}``And why don't you drink?''

{}``Coffee keeps me awake, and Mother and I have to be up early in the morning for work.''

{}``I have a long walk tonight. This coffee will keep me going.'' Yamik empties the small cup in one gulp and Aera
refills it.

{}``Now I'll tell you about that lad from their village,'' she says. {}``He's different from the rest of them there.
He's taking his high school final exams right now. He already got the forms for their army service. He'll apply for
deferment on the grounds that his mother is a widow and he's an only son. But that's just a pretext. The truth is that
he objects to anything military, anything to do with armies, fighting,~wars. In his spare time he works in a shop in
the village that sells radios and what not. One day he came to the office of the packing shed to talk to the
boss about something and that's~how we met. Only one thing interests him --- music.'' Aera realizes there's no point
telling Yamik about Glin's original{ }sense of humor. He wouldn't get it.

{}``Music?'' Yamik repeats a bit surprised.

``He doesn't go anywhere without his Walkman and earphones.''

{}``What's his name?''

{}``Glin.'' Aera touches the spot on her hair~where Glin had kissed her when they happened to bump into each other on
one of the village paths. She was without Mother then on an errand for the boss and there was no one around. ``We talk
about nothing much. I thought it might be useful if he believed that I've got some{\ldots}that I'm kind of{\ldots}attracted to him{\ldots}That it might be helpful for us.''

{}``My Aera is the wisest of women,'' Yamik claps his hands softly. ``And why is Mother so bothered?''

``If I explained this to her, in no time it'd be all over among our people. And that'd be the end of this{\ldots}plan.''

Yamik is~impressed, ``Go ahead and keep on talking with him about anything under the sun!'' He empties his second~cup of
coffee. ``Delicious.'' He catches Aera's hand as she refills his cup a third time, kisses it, then gently caresses
her hair. {}``In the whole wide world no hair shines like yours,{}'' he whispers.

Aera clenches her teeth --- her hair is not for him to touch. Now it belongs to Glin who uses the very same words.

Yamik, now sated with food and drink, stretches his legs leisurely. ``Shouba --- the man I told you about --- set up some
kind of a center for us, to collect second-hand stuff, clothes, bedding, appliances, etcetera.''

{}``People in this village also help us,'' says Aera. ``The work here is fine. And though this shack has obviously seen
better days, the roof doesn't leak and the wind doesn't blow in.''

{}``Is it so good~here that you forget about our Pale Blue Valley?''

{}``No. But it does make me remember that there are good people among them too.''

{}``Good and bad people are everywhere. That's not the point. And this business with the guard has to be done. My wife
has to prove that she's in it with us all the way.''

Yamik's life is fraught with hardship and danger, but Aera's secret love bores deep into her heart. How she wishes she
were someone else. She wants to extricate herself from her predestined share in the Balads{'} fate, distance herself from
their cause. ``When will you come for a longer stay?'' Her conscience lashes her for a question that springs from an
ulterior motive.

{}``Depends on how things go. I might get a pass to stay overnight closer to work.''

{}``That'd be great.'' Aera's heart again misses a beat. Yamik's visits will then be even rarer.

{}``Absolutely. Life will be easier for me. The camp is a long way from town.''

{}``Is it your contractor who'll arrange for your permit?'' Aera manages to exhibit serious interest.

{}``No. He did try once but wasn't successful. Now I intend to ask this well-meaning Shouba of the Center to try for me.
What did you say his name was?''

Aera feigns innocence, ``Who?''

{}``That skinny lad from their village?''

She has no choice, ``Ah{\ldots}Glin ---''

{}``Glin,{}'' Yamik commits the name to memory. ``By the way, do they know anything about me in the
village?''

``They don't'', Aera answers, ``they don't ask any personal questions and Mother
and I, of course, don't offer anything.''

``Let's keep it that way ---'' Yamik says.

Aera sees that he's about to spread his coat on the ground. ``Don't you have to get going? Aren't they waiting for
you?''

{}``There's still some time.'' Yamik draws~her close and she cannot but give in. ``I have only two things always on my
mind, bombs and love. No, love and bombs. No, three things --- love and bombs and a baby.''

Aera's shell-of-a-being is in Yamik's arms.{ }Her other self dissolves into Glin's.



\chapter{}

Zakod enters the storeroom and closes the door behind him. He lowers the shutters, fumbles his way to his desk, sits
down, turns on the reading lamp, puts a sheet of paper in front of him and starts to write:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{quotation}
Rimat my true love,

Again it is the end of winter. Spring is in the air. In other words,  a year has passed since I last wrote. So once
more it is time to tell you, A: that you do not owe me any explanation for your silence during all these many years;
B: that my arms are always open for you.

I hope you and Glin are~well.

By my reckoning Glin is going to be called up for the army any day now. I can imagine how you must feel about it. I pray
--- metaphorically speaking of course~because the void around me is free of any entity of judgment and justice --- for his
safety.

Do you remember that it was I who suggested his name? How Saffia clapped his hands and said, ``Glin! It
sounds so clear and pure! Clear and pure like one unique {note of music}!''

Rimat, forever my beloved, there has been a change in my life. Two months ago I fixed up a storeroom~about thirty paces
from the house. I put in a chair, a desk and a reading lamp. This is where I sit now as I write to you. It is here that I
shut myself once a day. I lower the blinds and conjure up in the dark what would have happened
``if''.~ These thoughts~instead of dissolving into nothing get more and more fleshed out with
time. Rimat, you will not believe it. I --- the personification of reason and rational deduction --- am carried away by
fantasy.~ Moiku and Blaya and Tiqvi are alive and well. They fill the house with their vitality. And not only is Dela
superbly healthy, but as mother of our three daughters her position at home has become equal to mine. What a cruel hand
life has dealt her! Her total dependence on me makes the complexities of our relationship from the beginning all the
more difficult.  If only it was me who was the half-paralyzed one sentenced to a wheel chair! That would be justice.
With her natural gift for devotion and solicitude she would be taking care of me.

I find work on the farm salubrious and enjoy the physical effort outdoors that it entails.~ And that is~in addition to
the common idea that flexing one's muscles is the secret elixir for good health. These muscles of mine were almost
totally degenerate. Can you imagine that I do not have the slightest desire to open a book? I read only newspapers now.
And that too only superficially. Here and there I listen to the radio and watch stupid programs~on TV. Ever since
HISTORY in capital letters happened to me, I say, LET IT BE DAMNED! This is what happened to the history professor who
lost his mind when the world around him was blown apart.

Rimat, my beloved for ever and ever, I am signing off.

Zakod goes over the letter, here deleting a letter that somehow got doubled, there adding a comma. He attributes these
mistakes to the natural, age-related, decline~of cognitive faculties.  He signs off, folds the letter, puts it in an
envelope which he addresses, and affixes a stamp in the top right corner. It will not wait to be posted in town when he
goes there in three days{'} time to do the~weekly shopping. Instead, he will get into his jeep right away, drive to the
far end of the farm and wait there for the mail-collection van.


\chapter{}

A car~draws up outside.{ }

Shouba hurries from the kitchen into the living room, not removing his stained apron. He rushes round the roomful of
odds and ends, junk strewn about. He'd intended to make the place look a bit more civilized in preparation for Boni's
visit but~had naturally forgotten all about it. Now, of course, it's too late. He rolls down his sleeves only to
discover that the buttons have fallen off the cuffs. Before rolling them up again he hears the doorbell. He runs to the
door, grabs the handle and lets it go --- twice. The third time he steels himself to open the door. Though he was
expecting Boni he freezes at the actual sight of him. Earlier he'd sworn to himself that in their conversation he
would find the right moment to mention Saffia's bomb-timers. Now he's sure he won't be up to it.

``Hello Shouba.'' Bonimi~smiles warmly offering his hand, which Shouba takes~hesitantly. He
isn't too surprised. Already in the old days Shouba was considered a bit dithery.  Also, since that at the end of
their phone conversation yesterday he had asked~his secretary to fix this appointment, there might be some confusion
about the day and time. ``Is this the right day and time?''

``Yes{\ldots}'' Shouba stammers still feeling awkward.

``May I come in then?'' Bonimi asks good-humoredly.

``Oh, sorry, Boni,'' Shouba steps back into the room, clearing a path through the~clutter for
his guest.

Being addressed by his old nickname affects Bonimi. It's been so long since he~heard it, so long that he's been known
by{ }one and all as Bonimi Saffia. He follows Shouba, apologizing, ``Sorry I
couldn't get here sooner.''

``You look so much like Saffia!'' Shouba puts a hand over his mouth, uncomfortable about the
way it slipped out.

``A veritable spitting image,'' Bonimi quips. ``My brother was handsome and
I'm~far from it. He was tall and I'm short, he was trim and I'm{\ldots}well{\ldots}plain pudgy. ''

``I'm sorry,'' Shouba apologizes, thinking: Saffia's face was unblemished,
and{ }you have a nasty scar on your cheek.  How did that happen,
he wonders. Saffia's young brother was always so quiet, so withdrawn, never got into fights.

Bonimi stretches his stubby fingers, ``And he had a fine hand, such delicate fingers ---''
What's all this gushing, he asks himself, but carries on, ``and when he played his fiddle ---''

Silence descends upon the room.

Shouba breaks it. ``I really appreciate your taking time to come here. Being CEO of the Public Television
Network is no small matter.''

Bonimi looks around and concludes with a genial wink, ``You evidently have no time for the
gasbag.'' He removes~his glasses and polishes them with a snow-white handkerchief.

``It's true I don't have much spare time,'' Shouba says shoving aside a heap of old clothes to
reveal an ancient TV set, ``but we do have to know what they want us to know.''

Bonimi accepts the barb with equanimity. ``It's eighteen years now since we saw each other.''

``Eighteen years?''

``Since Saffia ---''

``Oh my God!'' Shouba exclaims.

Bonimi attributes this outburst to the painful memory, but realizes he's wrong~as Shouba cries,
``Heavens!{ }I forgot!''
{ }and darts out of the room. He returns a moment later and explains,
``I forgot I left something on the burner in the kitchen.'' He glances at Boni's face. It's
as placid as ever. \textit{He} hasn't become forgetful. Because he's younger? Not necessarily. It's because he's solid.
That was their family. Saffia too was solid, so very solid. Saffia Saffia. Given name and surname the same. They called
him ``Double Saffia'' for a laugh. He pulls a threadbare blanket off the one armchair in~the
room and leans both hands on its armrests testing its stability ``Please ---'' he offers Boni
the armchair and then perches himself on a drawer-less chest of drawers.

Bonimi cautiously eases his thick form into the dubious armchair. This chaotic room in no way surprises him. Having
never come across Shouba's name anywhere all these years he has concluded that his older brother's friend `didn't
make it{}'. He would very much like to know what sparked this reunion. ``So how are things,
Shouba?'' he asks.

``Do you remember our old buddies?'' Shouba answers with a question.

``\textit{Your}~buddies,'' Bonimi corrects him gently. ``I was~much younger than all of you. I looked up to
`\textit{Saffia's buddies}'.''

Shouba's heart skips a beat at that term. It's so long since he last heard it. He asks, ``And do you
remember Alir?''

``But of course,'' Bonimi answers. ``Didn't we live together at Saffia and
Rimat's? Slept feet-to-feet in the glass veranda?''

``I forgot ---''

``How's he doing? Still writing~poetry?''

What luck that it's Boni who mentioned Alir's poetry! Shouba is encouraged. Now it's easier for him to go on:
``He published two collections{\ldots}small{ }editions.''

``He was the first poet I ever knew,'' Bonimi recollects fondly. ``I shall never
forget the way he would say that in a moment he would commit to memory the poem he'd conceived in his mind and heart
and then jot it down in his notebook. What's he doing these days?''

``He's teaching.''

``At what university?''

``Not even {at} a high-school.{  }{In a} primary
school{\ldots}and last month he got the sack ---''

``Why?'' Bonimi asks. This, he surmises, must be the reason for Shouba's phone call.

``They suddenly discovered that he didn't have a teaching diploma. A pretext, of course ---''

``Ah,'' Bonimi makes a shrewd guess. ``So the real reason was that poem he read
out~at the protest rally for the Balads?''

The fact that his guest distinguishes between~a pretext and a genuine motive bodes well for Shouba. Things are going the
right way. ``Yes and no,'' he says. ``It was his poem, alright, but \textit{he}
didn't recite it. Nor was he at the protest rally. He's not the type for demonstrations. And he wasn't commissioned to
write the poem. It was inspired. It got published in one of the literary supplements with his picture. And sometime
later, without asking him, the Balads made hundreds of~copies of it and distributed them as political leaflets ---
with his name and photo.''

Bonimi nods understandingly,~``I come across \textit{your }name in every flyer and every leaflet promoting
their cause. I so admire people who struggle for pure justice.''

``Justice is justice, no adjectives needed.''

``Right. But as for myself --- I don't preach,'' Bonimi smiles and continues in his mind, `nor
do I like to be preached at.'

Shouba is angry with himself for having allowed their friendly chat to take this unwelcome turn. He shouldn't have been
so damned impulsive, so stupid. What should he say now for the conversation to revert to its amicable track?

Bonimi is engulfed with past memories. This kind of argument reminds him of those shouting matches between his brother
and his buddies in the old days. ``It's terrible that this happened to Alir because of one
short poem,''  he says. ``Just because of{ }{a }mere three lines.''

Shouba is relieved. There's still hope. ``He's completely~gone to pieces,'' he says and
decides not to waste another moment. ``I was wondering if you could perhaps be of assistance to
him{\ldots}If maybe there's something for him in your area, say a series about poetry ---''

``I would be more than happy to help.''  The upcoming inauguration of the refurbished
auditorium springs to Bonimi's mind. Alir might fill a slot in the proceedings. That would be original.
``It may be an idea for the two of us to meet, talk it over.''

``Provided you don't give him false hopes ---''

``Naturally.''

``And that he doesn't suspect that I have anything to do with it ---''

``I won't implicate you with the slightest of hints,'' Bonimi winks good-naturedly.
``He once immortalized me in a poem. He described the way I wake up early in the morning when everything
is milky white. Do you remember why?'' Shouba shakes his head. ``Don't you remember that once
upon a time I was a milkman?''

``It begins to ring a bell. You used Saffia's bike.''

``The bike belonged to both of us,'' Bonimi wishes to be precise. ``Could you
give me Alir's phone number?''

``Here ---'' Shouba tears off {a bit of an }old newspaper and jots it
down.  ``And{\ldots}that poem ---'' he asks concerned.

``Forget it.'' From the inside pocket of his tailored jacket Bonimi produces an elegant
leather wallet. He inserts the scrap of paper into one of its folds, takes out a visiting card from another and hands
it to Shouba. ``Here's my direct number.''

This card must not get lost, Shouba warns himself, but where will he find a safe place for it in this mess? He folds his
fingers round it. He also knows that the visit should end now. His esteemed~guest's time is precious.
He's{ }angry with himself for being too cowardly to even hint at the other
subject he wanted to raise. He stands up quickly, inadvertently hitting a cooking pot placed on a bar stool, knocking
it to the floor. ``Sorry.'' It isn't clear to whom he's apologizing when he lifts up the
pot.

Bonimi guesses that Shouba wants to wind up this visit, but unlike him he'd prefer to prolong it. ``So this
is where you live?''  he asks casually.

``And work.''

``I was quite excited when my secretary told me you were on the line,'' Bonimi warmly
confesses. ``Does Alir have a family?''

``No.''

``Me neither,'' says Bonimi. ``And you?''

``I'm not eligible. The stuff I handle, the experiments.''

``Now it all falls into place.'' Bonimi's eyes open wide with enlightenment. ``It
was your photo in the papers reciting that poem at the rally. It said you're an applied chemist. So you turned your
hobby into a profession. Saffia said you mix all the components like one of those ancient alchemists.''

Shouba lowers his eyes. Maybe now is the time? Yes, a kind of a-propos, but he's too late.

Boni continues, ``The sparks that used to fly among you when you got together.'' Bonimi feels
the nostalgia welling up. It's not like him. Meeting Shouba has brought it on. ``They continued to fly
even after everyone left{\ldots}and Saffia and Rimat didn't stop arguing ---''

Shouba doesn't believe this. ``What about?''

``She wanted {him} to give it all up,'' Bonimi says. ``She said
`A married man who's going to be a father should devote his life to his family and that alone. Nothing else.{}' And
Saffia insisted one could fill several functions and meet many obligations at one and the same time. He was that kind
of person.''

Shouba nods in agreement.

``He adored Rimat,'' Bonimi carries on, ``he loved her passionately{\ldots}And he
was also a very good plasterer, and had a beautiful singing voice, and played the fiddle like a master. And{\ldots}for
the shortest time he was a father. And he was \textit{also} a freedom fighter.''
Bonimi welcomes the
itch in his scar. He clears his throat and continues, ``They'd sometimes ask my opinion, and I'd tell
them that I had none. And Saffia would say, `If everybody had no opinion, like you, what would the world come to?' And
I'd say that if everyone was like me, nobody would go without milk.''

Shouba is tickled.

``All three of us would also laugh then.'' Bonimi clears his throat again and finally pops the
question that has been there from the moment his secretary told him somebody by the name of Shouba was on the line,
``Do you know anything{\ldots}about{\ldots}Rimat?''

``No,'' Shouba shakes his head. ``Do you?''

``No,'' Bonimi says quietly. ``I heard that after the tragedy she went with the
baby --- my nephew --- to a village up north. Cut off all ties with me.'' Painful as it is, he must go on: ``The baby was
tiny then, maybe a month old. He had a lovely cradle, bought by Saffia at the flea market. And one of your crowd, who
was very handy{\ldots}''

``Gidal!'' Shouba interrupts excitedly.

``Right! Golden-Hands Gidal. Now I remember. He replaced the old worn out handles with new ones. Oh, the
memories that surface!''

``I forgot the baby's name,'' says Shouba.

``Glin. That was his name. Glin,'' Bonimi says. ``It was your friend the history
professor who suggested it{\ldots}I forget his name ---''

``Zakod,'' Shouba supplies the name. ``What a powerful mind that man
had!''

``How true,'' Bonimi agrees. ``Being so young of course I didn't take part in
your conversations and arguments. But I listened to them. And Professor Zakod made such an impression on me. He spoke
slowly. And his command of words! As if he was always lecturing to students. He also hated contractions. He wouldn't
say `I'm' but `I am', not `you're' but `you are'.'' Bonimi regrets having dwelt on Professor Zakod. He
would rather not to go into the tragedy that befell his family.

``Exactly,'' Shouba agrees, but the direction this conversation is taking is not at all to his
liking. He needs to clarify with his beloved friend's young brother the thing that has been weighing so heavily on him
these many years. ``I was close to Saffia because of our shared ideals,'' he says, believing
he has thus found the way to broach the subject.

``Yes, yes,'' Bonimi responds distractedly. ``If you should happen to hear
of{\ldots}Rimat{\ldots}anything ---''

``Of course{{\ldots}}'' Shouba leaves it at that.
``Would you like to give your chauffeur a ring?''

``No need. I'll walk back to the office.  A chance to use the old muscles.'' This time, when
he extends his hand, Shouba grasps it warmly and prolongs the handshake. All inhibitions now forgotten he finally comes
out with it: ``You know the bomb-timers were absolutely ok. I couldn't be more sure of it. For the life of
me I don't know what happened. They weren't~faulty. I was not at fault.''

Bonimi feels the scar on his cheek itching. How he cherishes this~one and only souvenir his brother left him --- not to be
shared with anyone. He sometimes feels he can never attach himself to a woman because then he'd have to explain it ---
and that's something he can't do. It's too intimate, too precious. Pushing away such thoughts he just says,
``I'm sure you weren't.''

Boni sounds genuine to Shouba. His words encourage him to continue, ``I checked the mechanisms several
times myself and also together with Saffia. I'll never understand till my dying
day{ }why the damned{ }bombs exploded
before they were meant to ---''

``You have nothing to blame yourself for,'' Bonimi says~emphatically. He waves his arms around
the room, ``May I ask what all this is about?''

``It's the least I can do for the Balads ---''

``{\thinspace}`The Center for Aid','' says Bonimi. ``The sign outside makes sense to me now.''

``I didn't want to write `The Center for Aid for Balads'. I didn't want to spell it out. You can understand
why. What should be done for them? What do you think?''

Bonimi shrugs. ``When I was a milkman my only worries were that~the milk I deliver should be fresh and
clean and that~the bike's tires be pumped up. Today I'm CEO of the~Public Television Network and~my only worry is
running it.~ Return to Pale Blue Valley? That's an idea I can't even begin to think about. Which marketing chain are
you connected with?''

``None. In the little lab in my kitchen all I produce is small quantities of household cleaning fluids and
detergents. I have an arrangement with some local shops. I'm not licensed to deal with hazardous
components.''

``Why?''

``The title~of {}`wild chemist' still clings to me.''

``The past does not let go, does it?'' Bonimi~chuckles and then, after a moment's
contemplation, conjures up Alir's poem and recites it beginning with its title: ``Next To / Next~to a
human being, I'm a human being / Next to a Balad, I'm a Balad / Next to a throwing hand I'm the grenade.''
Shouba's moving lips having accompanied him, he adds, ``I'm sure your rendition at the rally was much
better.'' He raises a hand in a parting gesture, opens the door and steps out. Shouba closes the door
behind him.

A resounding explosion rocks the building. Windows rattle. Shouba rushes to open the door. Boni re-enters, brushing dust
off his elegant jacket. Shouba is horror struck. ``Are you alright!?''

``I am,'' Boni hastens to assure him. {}``The bomb went off quite a long way away. The blast, though,
covered me with dust.''

``I had nothing to do with it,'' Shouba blurts out knowing full well his words are irrelevant.

``Come on, Shouba, I'm sure you don't meddle with those playthings anymore,'' Bonimi responds
calmly.  ``But now, to be practical, I \textit{must }make this phone call.''

 Before he locates it Shouba's phone is heard ringing somewhere.

``It might be for me,'' Bonimi says having no choice but to wait for Shouba to unearth the
phone~from under some tattered{ }blankets and hand him the receiver.

``Saffia speaking,'' he responds. ``Hello, Ezlip{\ldots}I'm fine{\ldots}Alive and
kicking{\ldots}Of course{\ldots}Please let Janha know ---'' By the time he puts the receiver down sirens of
police cars and ambulances shriek outside.

``The car will be here any minute,'' he tells Shouba. ``This is the world we live
in. And die in. For better or worse.''

\chapter{}

Oranges bounce along on the moving belt. Standing either side of it Aera and Mother pick out any imperfect fruit and
drop it in the box underneath. They work in sync, their hands briefly colliding now and again, at which Mother tut-tuts
and Aera releases a tinkle of laughter.

The crunch of bicycle tires on gravel is heard from outside. Aera's eyes meet Mother's for a fleeting second.

Glin~wheels his bike into the packing shed. He removes his earphones and smiles at Aera. She responds with a questioning
nod towards the new dressing he has --- this time on his right cheek. His arm too is bandaged.

Mother purses her lips at this overt sign of their acquaintanceship.

Boss Goshu opens the office door, ``Hi, Glin Saffia, is it all fixed up? Come in.''

Glin crosses the shed, leans his bike against the office partition and takes a small radio out of the saddle bag. Before
sitting down to explain to the boss what he has been able or unable to do he looks back to feast his eyes once more on
Aera. Instead, he's pierced by Black Mother's sharp glare. Why is she --- forever clad in black --- so angry with him?
Because Aera is a Balad and he isn't? An altogether meaningless difference.

``What's that for?'' Mother questions her daughter.

``Guess ---'' Aera teases, as she drops a few more perfect oranges into the box.

``What will the boss say?'' Mother growls. ``Don't we have enough worries as it
is?''

``He's not as fussy as you, Mother dearest. He let me understand that we too may enjoy some perfect
oranges.''

Aera takes the full box, stands it by the office door and waits behind it.

Mother hisses through her teeth, ``And what are you up to now?''

Glin emerges from the office to be impaled once again by Black Mother's glare.

``Boo-oo!''

He looks round, startled. Aera's laughing eyes peer at him from behind a box. As always, the happiness in her eyes is
marred. As always, there is a trace of melancholy there.

``Some healthy vitamins for your cuts and bruises,'' says Aera lifting the box for him to
take.

``A cornucopia!'' As Glin relieves her of the box~their fingers touch.

``Aera!'' Mother prompts Aera from her spot at the conveyer belt.

``Coming, Mother dear,'' Aera promises and whispers to Glin, ``She's \hbox{afraid ---''}

``Of what?''

``Of everything.''

``Same as my mom. Something else we have in common.''

``Glin!'' Goshu calls from the office doorway, ``A minute!''

``Please, Goshu,'' says Glin, ``don't trouble yourself any more on my account.
It's no use.''

Ignoring Aera's presence the boss comes up to Glin and pleads with him, ``Haven't you had enough of these
cuts and bruises?''

``Not at all,'' Glin humors him, ``I enjoy them all to the full.''

``But seriously, my dear young man, with your skills the army would grab you with both hands. They're
looking for experts in sound-engineering. And that'll be a real stepping stone for you after the army!''

``And you'll have endless opportunities later, in civilian life!''  Glin follows
ironically{ }in the same vein, ``What with all the useful contacts you'll have made, your
career will be assured! ~Dear Goshu, I promise to think about it.''

``If only I could believe you ---'' the boss shakes his head despairingly and
then adds, ``Congratulations, I heard that you passed the driving test ---''

``You see ---'' Glin chuckles, ``I'm not a lost case altogether ---''

The boss disappears in his office without another word.

{ }``What were you two talking about?'' Aera is curious.

``About nonsense,'' Glin answers her. ``But there \textit{is} something really
important to talk about. That song that you sing --- what is \textit{that} about?''

``It's about a place called `Pale Blue Valley'.''

``Is it real?''

``What do you mean real?''

``Is the valley real? Is the pale blue real? Is the song real?''

The sadness only hinted at before in the young woman's eyes now fills her face, ``Are \textit{you}
real?''

``Shall I come back when you're through?''

``We aren't allowed to remain here after work.''

``Aera!'' Once again Mother's fierce command is heard from her place at the conveyor belt.

``Just one minute, Mother dear!'' For a brief moment\MakeUppercase{ a}era turns to Mother to
reassure her and then immediately turns back to Glin. ``How d'you get all these cuts and
bruises?''

``Sheer carelessness ---''

Aera points to the nape of Glin's neck, ``And this?''

``I lay on a sharp nail to deaden the pain of my longing for you.''

``And the truth?''

``Some truths are~meaningless,'' Glin puts on a look of disdain, ``limited and
simplistic.''

``Some,'' Aera smiles sadly, ``only some ---''

``Where, Aera? \textit{Where}?''

Aera, lowering her voice, speaks quickly, ``Once you're out of the gate, keep going along the fence as far
as the stream bed. It's dry now. Cross it and climb up the opposite bank. There, facing you, is a
cave.''

``When?''

``Two nights from tonight. But keep coming here. So my mother will think we only see each other
here.''

Glin wheels his bike back through the packing shed taking care not to turn his head and risk Black Mother's piercing
eyes again.

Aera resumes her post opposite Mother at the belt.

``You learned to chatter in their language,'' Mother admonishes her.

``So did Yamik.''

``Not for chatter. For things that are important.''

``You'll yet be proud of your Aera, Mother dear.~ Just wait and see.''



\chapter{}

``So what's new?'' asks Yamik as the contractor climbs back into the truck and makes himself
comfortable in the passenger seat.

``First let's get going,'' the contractor suggests, happy that his trustworthy foreman also
spares him the trouble of maneuvering through the city traffic on top of everything else. Once Yamik skillfully merges
into the moving line of vehicles he asks him, ``What d'you want first --- the bad or the
good?''

``First the good,'' Yamik responds.

``You always prefer the good news first, don't you?'' the contractor humors him.

``Who knows if I'll survive until the bad,'' Yamik replies.{ }

``I guess you're right, pal,'' says the contractor, ``but why so
gloomy?''

``Just a passing thought,'' Yamik says and silently adding to himself, `that won't leave me.'
Three of the men were killed in the failed attack last month, and in the last roundup he wasn't arrested thanks only to
a negligent soldier who'd been fooled by his blind old Balad get-up.

``Well, the CEO seems to be all for giving us the project,'' the contractor is pleased to
share the good news with his trustworthy foreman. ``He's quite unique around these parts. He only thinks
of the main points. No ulterior motives, no ego games. I'd never imagine that our Public Television Network could have
such a CEO.''

``And the bad news?''

``The bad news has to do with his number one aide, a bigshot with an inflated ego who says there are a few
more things they still need to consider.''

``Did you tell him about the renovations we've done at the museum?''

``Of course. And he said he'd go over there and take a look. Let's hope he's impressed.''

Yamik joins the contractor in mute prayer.

``They promised to have an answer within a week,'' says the contractor and adds,
``but truth to tell, Yamik, I myself started having doubts whether we can handle it ---''

``Why not?'' Yamik asks, hoping not to give away his serious{ }concern about
such possible doubts. Renovating the auditorium in the television building means a close knowledge not only of that
specific structure but of the whole surrounding area. Most precious information.

``Aren't we going to over-extend ourselves?'' The contractor knows he can share his misgivings
with his foreman. ``Between the Eastern Hills Project and the town center?''

``The main consideration --- to my mind --- is to get a foot in the door and not let a good opportunity slip
by.''

``Were it not for you, young man, I wouldn't even consider it. Because if we do land this job we'll have to
split up for a while. I'll be here in town at the TV building site, and you'll be up there on the Eastern Hills
Project.''

``It'll be OK,'' Yamik assures the contractor hoping that in time he'll be able to convince
him to switch places.

``Oh, Yamik,'' the contractor pats his foreman's sturdy shoulder. The time and energy he's
invested in training him has borne fruit. ``You won't fall for any of those silly ideas like some of
your{\ldots}people ---'' he says awkwardly. ``You'll get ahead in life.''

``Thanks for the compliments and the prediction.''

``As for the renovation of the auditorium in the TV building --- there'll be~a tight schedule there. They're
planning a big inauguration ceremony, the whole works including at least one VIP.''

``That's certainly one more reason for you to be involved,'' Yamik interjects.
``It'll give you a lot of free publicity. How much time do we have for the renovation?''
Yamik wonders if his ``we'' was wise.

The contractor, however, is pleased to hear that ``we'' --- it means real collaboration. ``Four
months.'' he says.

The truck goes three quarters of the way around the remodeled roundabout and begins to ascend the newly paved road~to
the site of the Eastern Hills Project.

``Whenever my son, who manages{ }to take a university course while he's doing his army
service, has to submit a paper by a certain date, he calls that date a `deadline' because of the killing
stress.'' The contractor regrets his words. His Ouli and his foreman Yamik are about the same age --- but
how different their lives! Babies are born and their lot~is cast. How fortunate. How unfortunate.

This expression --- ``a deadline'' --- is new to Yamik. He makes a mental note to remember it.
Aloud he ponders, ``Four months ---''

``Is that a lot or a little?'' asks the contractor.

``\textit{It's four months}.''

The contractor points to the top of the hill their truck is presently climbing, ``Coming along nicely,'' he
observes. ``By the way, I'm so sorry I didn't succeed in getting you a pass to stay there overnight.''

``There's somebody else looking into it,'' says Yamik. ``Let's hope ---''

``Let's hope, indeed ---'' the contractor agrees


\chapter{}

Shouba is looking for Boni's business card. Finally he gets down on all four and finds it in a crate-full~of cast-off
toys. Fortunately it's perfectly intact ---  probably thanks to its high-quality paper. He goes over to the phone and
dials the number. After one and a half rings~the receiver is picked up.

``Saffia speaking,'' Bonimi identifies himself in his formal yet pleasant voice --- scanning in
his mind the limited number of people entrusted with his personal phone number.

``Boni{\ldots}?'' ventures Shouba.

Who could call him by his old nickname and with such familiarity, Bonimi asks himself, checking that the receiver is
plugged into the black phone between the red and the green ones. Then it clicks. ``Shouba?''

``Sorry to bother you ---''

``Not at all,'' Bonimi responds warmly. ``Did you speak with Alir?''

``I did and thanks to you he's back to his old self. But this call isn't to do with him. Do you have a
moment?''

``But of course ---'' Bonimi hears a tap on the door and watches Janha enter and place a stack
of papers on his desk. She motions that she has something to say to him. Covering the mouthpiece he tells her he'll
speak with her after he's done with the present call. She leaves the room and he uncovers the mouthpiece,
``Sorry, Shouba, you were saying{\ldots}?''

``I haven't said anything yet. First of all I want to know whether you have a moment ---''

``But of course ---''

``There are two things ---''

``One{\ldots}?'' Bonimi though~pressed for time is encouraging.

``Yes. One. After you left, I couldn't remember if I told you that the bomb-timers I made for Saffia were
perfect~-''

``You certainly did, Shouba,'' says Bonimi sensing the beginning of the itch in his scar,
``and I said that from the very beginning I didn't for a second doubt it.''

``I can't imagine what happened ---''

``Shouba, it wasn't your fault.''

``What could've gone wrong there at the last minute?''

Bonimi asks himself why his late brother's friend keeps harping on the tragedy. Shouba cannot know that \textit{he} ---
Bonimi --- was the last person to be with his brother before the explosions. Nobody knows about that and so it must
remain. Shouba goes on and on about those bomb timers he devised for Saffia because he cannot do otherwise. Bonimi
can sympathize with that. Too bad the itch will soon wear off. He cherishes its every moment. ~``And
two?'' he prompts Shouba, uneasy about the fact that he can't get the edge off  his voice because he is
indeed pressed for time.

Shouba, sensing that vocal nuance, blames himself again for his inability to keep himself in check. If he doesn't learn
to be careful he could block this channel of communication Boni has opened for him so generously. He says,
``Number two has to do with a young Balad man ---''

``What about him?''

``He's the foreman of a big contractor in town who's presently involved in the renovation of the auditorium
of your TV building and in the famous Eastern Hills Project. Anyhow, this young Balad would like to be able to stay
overnight in town. For obvious reasons he~needs a pass.''

``Sorry, but I don't know anybody~in that area.'' Bonimi deliberates within himself whether to
remain on the subject and decides to do so. ``But, really, Shouba, why should you take responsibility for
such a thing? It's so risky.''

``This Balad is a quiet, decent, solid young man,'' Shouba continues, ignoring Boni's
reservations. ``He sometimes comes to the Center, so I came to know him. He's married and plans on having a
family. Right now he lives in a camp on the other side of town that was set up for Balads working in town. But it's
quite a long walk twice a day back and forth. I heard of two quite similar cases who did get those
permits.''

``It's playing with fire.''

``But in any case they go through security and all that when they enter town ---''

Bonimi restrains himself as best he can, ``And if he \textit{does} get involved with something? Even though
you may be only a small link in the chain, it'll reach you. They won't let your Center for Aid remain open. And that
Center of yours is doing such an important job. Is it worth jeopardizing it? In any case, as I said, I don't have any
contacts in that area. But as far as Alir is concerned, I'm pretty sure it'll work out.''

``Thanks so much for what you did for him. And sorry for bothering you.''

``But you haven't, Shouba.  Really. You haven't at all.'' Bonimi realizes it's his turn to
apologize. ``What I said about that Balad --- that was just my personal opinion. For your own good. It's
been really good{ }talking to you.''

``Same here, Boni,'' Shouba says, happy that the communication channel is still open.
``Goodbye then ---''

``Goodbye,'' Bonimi replaces the receiver. The connection~with Shouba remains open. So one of
these days Rimat might surface.

Replacing the receiver, Shouba tells Yamik who is awaiting the outcome of the phone conversation, ``He
can't.''

Yamik feels free to add, ``Nor does he want to.''

``And I don't know anybody else.''

``Thanks all the same for your time and willingness.''

Once again Shouba is impressed by Yamik's command of the language.  Only his accent gives his Balad origins away.



\chapter{}

Dela's wheelchair is pushed all the way to the table. She's singing ``Happy birthday to
Moiku''. In her hands she holds a picture of a small girl. She'll never be sure whose face it is. All
three girls lost their front left tooth at the same age --- six and a month. All three of them had this round face with
plump cheeks framed by golden curls. And that gingham dress with the white baby collar was handed down from Moiku to
Blaya to Tiqvi. On each of their birthdays she holds in her hands the only picture that survived the
fire. ``At the time we never thought we should write a name and a date on the back,'' she
remarks to Zakod seated opposite.

``Sing some more,'' he says looking below the table. The last repair the carpenter did under
his instructions proved a success. Dela's lifeless feet stopped bumping into the table legs. He raises his head again.
A sumptuous birthday cake decorated with colored frosting and a myriad of brightly burning ornamental candles~stands on
the table between him and Dela. He had set out the three alternatives on the first birthday they celebrated: no candle
at all, a single candle, multitude of candles.~ Dela opted for the third. Why should he be the one to lay down the
rules --- he later chided himself. Did~they not share equally in the conception of each of the three girls? Did she not
carry each of them full term? Did she not suffer the pains of childbirth three times? Did she not suckle each baby?
Cared for them day and night? And had she not done for them all along far more than he did? But from the very
beginning, because of their different natures and their incompatibility, it was always \textit{his} say that
prevailed.

Dela dares to shake her head. ``Please, once is enough,'' she pleads. She doesn't say that
even already at age five Moiku said exactly that. Today, at fifteen, she might not have agreed to have the birthday
song sung for her even once. But, perhaps on the contrary, she would have started to mature and mellow? Dela gazes
tenderly at the small flames, happy to have gone for the third option. The mass of candles is gaudy, but it does
remove the gloom.

Zakod begs, ``Please, yes.''

``Let's sing together,'' Dela gently suggests.

``I'll hum along,'' Zakod concedes, ``you know I cannot carry a
tune.'' He could never abide those inane words of the birthday song. But he knows all too well what made
him so amenable today. It is Rimat's letter. Now he remembers how she was always teasing him about his tone-deaf
singing --- which would get Saffia mad at her.  The song concluded, he slides the cake closer to Dela for her to blow
out the candles.  At night, after bedtime, he'll return the cake to its cardboard box. It is a cake made with fatty
ingredients and too much sugar --- not healthy for either of them.

Dela asks, ``Who will you give it to this time?''

``To the annual collective birthday celebration for orphans of fallen soldiers,'' says
Zakod~as he wheels Dela opposite the TV set and turns it on. He then prepares their supper. While setting the table for
two, he glances at the screen every once in a while. He turns the set off when the hero and heroine finally walk hand
in hand toward the sunset. He then wheels Dela to the sink to wash her hands.

``Already?'' Dela dares to express some annoyance. She wanted to hear the music till the end
and see the lists of the cast and credits.

``For all practical purposes the movie's over, and soon the news will be on. Remember what the doctor said
--- that it is not good for us to watch the news.'' Using the first person plural has become second nature
with him in conversations with his wife. He helps her~wash and dry her hands and wheels her back to her place at the
table. ``Bon app\'etit.'' He slips into her hands the special~knife and fork he found in the
rehabilitation section of the army surplus store.

``Thank you,'' Dela says and her heart goes out to him. Not enough that he puts so much effort
into preparing the food, but he also has to eat the tasteless fruits of his labor. ``Mm, this is good!''
she compliments him.

``Is it hot enough?''

``It's just right.''

``I'm going into town tomorrow.''

Dela is quite conscious of her husband's stress the day before his weekly trip to town. On those mornings he prepares a
sandwich and a drink for her lunch. As he leaves home he never fails to ask her without turning to face her, `Anything
else you would like from town apart from what is on the list?'  `Nothing, thanks,' she always replies. Then he
opens the door and with a perfunctory word of farewell leaves the house.

Zakod begins to clear up, weaving back and forth between the table, the sink and the fridge. When he starts doing the
dishes with his back to Dela he addresses her, ``A while ago we spoke about having some help at home. We
thought that it would be a sound idea. But I could not find anyone suitable. Now, at long last, I did. It is a woman
about our age. A widow.~ I do not need her to send me her recommendations. I can tell by the way she presents herself
in writing.''  He assumes, correctly, that Dela will not ask to see that letter.  ``She
made two conditions,'' he goes on, ``one,~that the place of work should also provide accommodation --- which
is not only possible but would suit us very well too.~ She could move in downstairs.''

``That's very good,'' Dela responds, thinking: very good for which one of us?

``She has a son aged about eighteen,'' Zakod continues, now turning to face is wife,
``so her second condition is that her son joins her. He could help me on the farm.''

``Excellent!'' Dela responds full-heartedly.

{}``The son is now in the middle of his final matriculation examinations. They will come when he has finished. I will
write to her that there are two rooms downstairs, one leading into the other. I hope she will not mind.''

\chapter{}

``Glin!'' Rimat is shocked at the sight of her son, his face again bruised and bleeding.

``It's nothing, mom,'' he'll not have her worrying about him. ``I just tripped over, stupid
me.''

``And what kind of a fool do you take \textit{me} for?'' His arm too is bleeding and his
sleeve's torn. ``Go wash your face.'' She hurries after him to the sink to clean and dress
his wounds. ``The moment you're through with those exams we say goodbye to this place and get away from
these hooligans! But what are those sirens!?'' She runs to the window. An ambulance~is clambering up the
dirt road of the old gate. People milling around it add to the commotion. ``What happened?''

``They found Moshko lying on the ground near the gate. Dead.''

``What?!'' Rimat is aghast. ``Yesterday evening, when you
looked out of the window at those two singing Balad women, you said afterwards that you'd seen Moshko fall down and
then get up ---''

``My mistake because it was dark outside ---'' says Glin.

``What do you mean?'' Rimat asks.

``Seems it was someone else who got up,'' he says.

Rimat's first reaction is to feel sorry for Moshko. Then she remembers the grievance she's held against him these
past{ }eighteen years. He was the one who stopped her at the village gate questioning her so nastily
whom she was coming to. When she told him it was Gidal, he said he'd go and check. He'd slammed and bolted the gate in
her face then, one of her hands gripping the handles of the baby's cradle, the other holding the violin case, a
rucksack full of clothes on her back. Next moment she was sorry for him again, remembering that  his wife had died not
long ago and since then there was no one waiting for him at home, no one who'd notice his absence all night. By the
fourth moment she's getting worried. ``Did you tell anyone what you saw? Or what you think you
saw?''  she asks.

``No.''

``Good. Why get involved? Aren't we out of here --- practically speaking?''

Meanwhile the ambulance has driven past the window on its way to the village center. The sirens have gone quiet. Rimat
turns again to Glin and adjusts the bandage on his arm.

``Mom, did you ever hear of a place called `Pale Blue Valley'?''

``I think the Balads say they came from there ---''

``{\thinspace}`Pale Blue Valley','' Glin repeats the name. ``Sounds like a legend, a
myth.''

``Doesn't take much to make up names for places or ideas,'' Rimat says. ``And
didn't I already tell you a thousand times that it's dangerous to be tempted by legends and myths? I don't mind saying
it again for the thousand and one time.''

They both know who's knocking at the door. Still, Rimat calls out, ``Who's there?''

Gidal opens the door just a crack. ``May I come in?''

``Can't you come in like a normal human being?'' Rimat responds, slightly
impatient.

Gidal takes two steps inside and then stops when he becomes aware of Glin's presence. He asks, ``Did you
hear about what happened to Moshko?''

``Yes,'' says Rimat. ``Terrible!''

``They think the Balads had a hand in it,'' he says. ``They say that the police
are going to interrogate the two Balad women who work in the packing shed. Tell me, could a woman do such a thing?
Blaming people for nothing. I myself often saw Moshko stumble and fall over. And this time --- very-very unfortunately!
--- he fell on that iron peg sticking out of the ground. I once tried to pull it out but I couldn't.''

Rimat decides that for her own and Glin's sake she should add, ``Yes, I too often saw him
fall.''

``And you,'' Gidal looks at both of them, ``did you see anything? Hear anything?
You're the closest to this old gate ---''

``We didn't,'' Rimat shakes her head decidedly.

``I expect they'll want to put a few questions to you too,'' Gidal feels he should prepare
Rimat for any unpleasantness he won't be able to prevent. To be honest, he should also tell that to Glin, but he knows
that as far as this young lad~is concerned he doesn't amount to much.

``Let them,'' Rimat says. ``Let them ask questions to their heart's
content.'' Gidal's incessant solicitousness~has become a damned nuisance. But she's so indebted to him for
all he's done for her. Yes. On the one hand she can understand why Glin can't take him. On the other hand, she'd rather
have him be nice to this old friend of hers, this kind man who is blessed with golden-hands.

``The final exam in history is in half an hour,'' announces Glin. ``Mom, won't
you wish me something?''

``Good luck ---''

``What an original, creative mind!'' Glin clicks his tongue and leaves.

Now, alone with~Rimat, Gidal feels at ease. He makes himself comfortable in the armchair without being asked.
``I always had a soft spot for Moshko,'' he says. ``He was on duty, remember,
the night you arrived. He came to my place and told me there was a woman at the gate. `She's coming to see you,' he
said.''

``Right at the beginning I should have made it clear to you that~my life with Saffia was not over, that you
should have no illusions,'' Rimat speaks softly. ``I shouldn't have put it off. But I was afraid that otherwise you
might not help me settle here with the baby.''

``Rimat,'' Gidal caresses her with his bovine eyes. Now is the time to tell her what has been
on the tip of his tongue for quite{ }a while. ``Listen, Rimat, everybody knows that Glin's
deferment is only a way of buying time. Until he can get out of the army altogether ---''

``To you I can say that that's true.''

``Don't you two know that the army offers boys like Glin wonderful opportunities?''

``Wonderful opportunities ---'' Rimat sneers. ``All kinds of opportunities whose
final aim is to kill. I brought Glin up to abhor all manner of killing. And I succeeded.''

Unable to argue with this Gidal looks for something to do with his hands. He picks up the cradle and checks the handles.
Still ok. He's modestly proud of his handwork.

Smiling warmly Rimat finds a way to compensate him, ``I'll never forget how you replaced the old ones with
these. So clever.''

``When are you leaving?''

``The day after the last exam.''

``I{\ldots}I've renovated my place{\ldots}'' Gidal stammers,~``it's really
comfortable{\ldots}now ---''

``What are you talking about?  That Glin would leave and I'd stay here?''

``He isn't a child anymore.''

``You know that he's like a pledge{ }with me.''

``And when\textit{ he'll} want to leave \textit{you}?''

``When that happens, it'll be \textit{his} decision.''

She has an answer for everything, Gidal realizes, but still whispers, ``May I ask{\ldots}?''

``Where we're going?''

Gidal nods.

``Remember Zakod?''

``The history professor?''

``Throughout all the years he's written to me every once in a while ---'' Not to hurt Gidal's
feelings Rimat doesn't specify that it has been{ }{punctually}{ }every
spring. ``He's always offered his help. I never responded. Some weeks ago I wrote him and explained our
situation. Well{\ldots}Once upon a time you made it possible for us stay here thanks to{ }the goodness
of your heart. Now it'll be the same thing at his place.''

``That shocking disaster{\ldots}'' Gidal  shudders at
the memory. ``It was so like him to get the best~defense lawyer for those two Balads ---
described as penniless. He always had to argue objectively no matter what. Thanks to him the two of them got off
because of `a shadow of doubt'. What did Saffia see in him?''

``What did Saffia see in \textit{you}?'' Rimat responds and hastens to add,
``What did Saffia see in \textit{me}? Saffia's eyes were wide and his heart warm. In each one of us he saw
some reflection of himself.''

``If I'd been able to overcome my panic --- hearing about his plan to blow up the citadel --- I'd have gone
with him to the citadel and been killed there with him.''

``But you might have saved him!''

``You'd never stop blaming me.''

``Never. And neither shall I ever forget that had you not panicked in time, that had you stuck with
Saffia, I wouldn't have had whom to turn to with my baby.''

Gidal grasps Rimat's hands, almost kisses them.

\chapter{}

Aera clearly doesn't want to talk about it. But Yamik, sitting with her on the bench outside, can't help
himself.  ``The men know that you did it,'' he says quietly.

A shudder runs through her ``Sh{\ldots}''  She hushes him, grateful to Mother for keeping
silent as she prepares supper indoors.~ Ever since the \textit{act}, Mother
has honored her request to keep quiet
about it.

Yamik moves closer, takes Aera's hand, covers it with kisses. ``The main thing is that you did it and you
did it well,'' he says.

Aera hopes Yamik has nothing more to say about the subject. Pre-empting his imminent embrace she pulls her hand away,
finding an excuse to stand up --- she must stop the shutter's rattling.

With Yamik present Mother allows herself to break her daughter's request. She appears at the doorway waving a wooden
spoon, ``You must always remember why we three are the only survivors!''

``Let us be, Mother dear,'' Aera entreats Mother, attributing her loose tongue to Yamik's
presence.

``I'm old,'' Mother continues, ``I'm weak. You two are young and strong. You two
know what you should do.''

``And we'll do it,'' Yamik promises, relieved when Mother disappears inside the shack leaving
the two of them to themselves.

``Don't you ever~ask me to do such a thing again,'' Aera hisses.

``There won't be any~need,'' Yamik wishes to put Aera at ease. ``You should've
heard what the men said about my wife ---''

``I don't want to hear!''  Aera stops him.

But Yamik can't stop himself. He so loves quoting the words of praise heaped on his wife when her \textit{act} became
known. ``That she's not only brave but is also capable and clever. I wanted to say, `and also beautiful',
but I didn't. Your beauty is ours and ours alone.''

Yamik's loving words are an anathema to Aera. She's on edge. ``What did \textit{you} do to be
accepted?'' she asks sarcastically. ``No-no, don't tell me. I don't want to
hear.'' She's silent for a moment and then threatens, ``If you ever do such a thing again
---''

``I won't,'' Yamik stretches an arm to put round her. Aera diverts it with a handshake,
``Promise. Swear.''

``I promise. I swear. \textit{When it's up to me}. Don't you understand that if we want~to achieve our
goal, it is sometimes \textit{necessary}? \textit{That sometimes we have no choice}?''

``If that's the case maybe it means we should give~up.'' The words just popped out. She
doesn't know how.

{}``What do I hear?'' Mother shouts from indoors. ``Give up?''

{}``Auntie, please,'' Yamik begs.

{}``Why not stay away from the men~and be independent?'' Aera hurtles on not knowing where she's heading,
``One has to think for oneself, do things on his own.''

``Yamik, my son, something's happened to our Aera,'' Mother reappears at the window.
``My daughter --- your wife ---  doesn't understand how these things are done.''

Yamik turns to Mother again, affectionately, ``Auntie, please ---''

Aera calms down, ``I think to myself, why don't they accept our demand? Perhaps because they don't
understand it. If they did, if \textit{many} of them did, then perhaps they'd come around and change their
minds.''

``Right,'' Yamik agrees for the sake of peace.

``We must explain what happened,'' Aera goes on, ``what we demand. Our legitimate rights.
Justice.''

Yamik would so like to go along with Aera. ``I'll put it to the men,'' he says.

``Don't!'' Aera jumps at him. She can't understand what induced her to speak this way to
Yamik. Is she trying to convince him to stay away from the men because she --- for her own reasons --- wants to part from
him? Doesn't she know that these are two wholly separate issues? How painfully aware of it she is! But now it's too
late. She rushes ahead, ``The men won't understand it, won't accept it.~ They won't agree.''

``You're right,'' Yamik nods, not knowing what else to say. ``That nice man of
theirs,'' he changes the subject, ``the one that set up that Center for Aid for us, couldn't get me a permit to stay
overnight on the site of the new building project I told you about. But I stay there~all the same and nobody knows. And
it suits my contractor very well because we have to split up for some time. He's supervising~the renovation of the
auditorium in the TV~building in the middle of town and~I'm in charge of that~new project.''

``So at long last your contractor~did get that job with~the television authorities?''

``He did. I forgot to tell you.''

Aera has a brainwave, ``Perhaps you can switch places?''

``What for?'' Yamik is intrigued.

``There's a TV set in our boss's office,'' she says feeling Yamik's eyes looking deeply into
her own.  ``It's always switched on. Sometimes, when I'm waiting until he's free to speak with me about
whatever he asked me to come in for, I watch~it. Movies, news, all kinds of programs. Just imagine that hundreds of
people, thousands, tens of thousands of people watch and hear what's broadcast. Food for thought, isn't
it?''~ What she had blurted out earlier to displace the oppressive feeling dogging her about her and Yamik
has now emerged as a sound idea.

``My Aera ---'' Yamik is excited. He knows about different programs broadcast on television.
He's watched them in places where he worked. Aera's idea is a challenge --- though heaven knows how he could put it into
practice. But when he does, he'll prove his independence of thought and action and win her admiration. He's aware of
the way she proved her own creative thinking, through cultivating the friendship between herself and
that lad from the village. He asks jokingly. ``And what's going on with that skinny one? Who's only crazy
about music?''

``He's got one foot outside the village.''

``Why?''

``Doesn't want to sign up for their army. And they're giving him a hard time. Calling him names, pushing
him into thorny bushes, throwing things at him --- even stones. ~He told me that he and his mother will soon be leaving
the village to move somewhere near town.''

``Does he{\ldots}still have a soft spot for you --- ?''

``Seems like it ---''

``Keep it up after he leaves the village.''

``How?''

``By mail.''

``Mother will hit the roof if she sees that we're writing to each other ---''

``Tell him to bring his letters to that Center for Aid in town. It's in the new shopping mall.  Opposite
the supermarket there's an apartment building on the left with three entrances. Next to the middle entrance there's a
sign: `Center For Aid'. And that's also where I'll leave your letters for him. I'll be your go-between
mailman.''



\chapter{}

Bonimi's~desk is covered{ }with sketches detailing the renovation. He and his aide Ezlip pore over them,
helping each other~decipher them by locating the~auditorium's demolished walls, the newly built walls, the angle of the
stage, the expanded seating area that would double the number of seats in the auditorium from fifty to a
full{ }hundred.

{}``It's thanks to you that this renovation is going so well,'' Bonimi{ }praises his aide.

``Thanks for the complement, sir,'' Ezlip responds, ``but the contractor deserves
a lot of credit too. He's really tops. And this morning he told me about a slight change. Taking into account that he's
going to be busy with the Eastern Hills Project for some time, his foreman will be in charge here. ~He's a Balad, but
the contractor swears{ }by him.'' Observing that the CEO is studying the sketch of the
lobby, he adds, ``he thinks your suggestion to{ }have the information desk against the
wall was nothing short of genius.''

``No need to go overboard,'' Bonimi chuckles.

But Ezlip continues in this vein, ``This change, first of all, enlarges the lobby physically, and secondly,
it gives it a sense of space.''

``I confess that I didn't think about the `secondly','' Bonimi says. ``And that's
not false modesty.''

``I have to tell you, sir, you have an unusual grasp of sketches and drawings. Very few --- if any ---
non-professionals can boast that.''

``Oh, please!'' Bonimi is wondering what all this flattery's about. What's his aid after?

Ezlip, while sensing the CEO's reservations, remarks casually, ``in `Who's Who' I discovered that you used
to be a photographer.''

``I admit to it,'' Bonimi raises his right hand. He knows Ezlip can't help looking at his scar
now and again. On more than one occasion he's mentioned names of reputable{ }plastic surgeons he could
consult. He's always thanked him, said he'd look into it, but of course didn't. ``I used to be a milkman
for my livelihood. Photography was just a hobby. But that hobby indeed got my foot in the TV world,'' he
casually reminisces.

``You probably have a treasure-trove of photos somewhere in an old shoe box ---''

``I do admit to having an old shoe box. As for a treasure-trove in it --- it's almost
empty.''

``It's an idea that has occurred to me that along with the inauguration of the new auditorium we could
mount a retrospective `Past and Present' exhibit --- photographs of people who are part of this place taken at
different stages of their lives.''

``Excellent idea, indeed. But being the photographer there're no photos of myself in that old shoe box.
Only photos of other people --- family and friends.'' Bonimi is sure the wave of sadness that engulfs him
escapes Ezlip's notice.  Each one of the photos in the old shoe box is so very dear to him. Every once in a while he
looks at them. Saffia, eyes closed, playing the violin. Rimat, washing the dishes, making a face at him. Baby Glin,
three weeks old, half-smiling half-yawning. Alir --- holding an eraser between his teeth --- immersed in his notebook. Two
pairs of shoes --- one his and one Alir's --- on the floor of the glass veranda. A textbook of Zakod's entitled
``Old Versus Obsolete'' in the middle of the table. Saffia's overalls hanging out to dry, his
paint-spattered ladder leaning against the wall, some cans and brushes next to it. ~Saffia propping up baby Glin on the
bicycle seat and~Rimat's fingers keeping his small body from slipping off. ~Her scream, `Careful, you loony!' echoes in
his ears. What's missing among this collection is the photo he once took of Saffia waking up from a nap --- face puffy,
hair disheveled,{ }{eyes
unfocused.} ~Rimat loved that photo and appropriated it. He'd planned to print another picture from~the negative, but
the tragedy devastated everything before he got around to it, and the negatives were lost forever.

``What about the ceremony?'' Ezlip asks. ``Is it finalized?''

``Alir --- the poet --- is still working on it,'' Bonimi answers. ``It'll take him a
few more days.''

From the very start Ezlip had been against the choice of Alir to MC the ceremony --- giving the impression of a
scatterbrain. He could simply lose it in the middle of the proceedings. But the CEO had thrown his full weight behind
his choice, maintaining~that appointing an MC who is a poet and not one of those~slick professionals would help rid TV
of its stuffy image.{ }~Ezlip now finds a way to avoid denigrating Alir as a person by remarking,
``His notorious poem hasn't increased his popularity.''

``There's no need to blow that poem out of proportion,'' Bonimi responds. ``What
really~happened when all's said and done? The Balads and their supporters let off some steam.''

Ezlip doesn't~deny this but the expression on his~face clearly conveys a lack of consent. He collects the renovation
sketches from the CEO's desk and puts them in his briefcase. ``And there was another reason for my leafing
through `Who's Who','' he says as if off-handedly, ``I heard that in one chapter of our
past history your brother was a freedom fighter. I wanted to read about him. So I looked up all the Saffias in the
index, but only found yours. What was his first name?''

``Saffia. It was both his first and last name. His friends would sometimes pull his leg and call him
`Double Saffia' ---'' Bonimi feels his scar~beginning to itch. He's dying to touch it but doesn't of course.
How it bled then together with Saffia's blood, the earth soaking up the blood of both of them. ``It was a
short, complicated, terrible episode in what was called the Phony Occupation.''

``They give it about two lines in history books,'' says Ezlip. ``How do you see
it now?''

``A wrinkle in history. My brother wanted to straighten it out.''

``How?''

``Do you know the Citadel?'' What's he after? --- Bonimi asks himself --- this highly intelligent,
ambitious, calculating young man?

``Of course I do.''

``The occupation force had its headquarters there. My brother blew up one wing of their building. And was
one of its casualties. It was a tragedy for the family, for his friends. \textit{But mainly} \textit{for
himself}.''  While speaking Bonimi feels the itch in the scar turning into a burn. How he loves that
heat. ``Excuse me,'' he says to Ezlip and clicks the internal line, ``Janha ---''

``Yes, Mr. Saffia?'' the secretary's voice comes over the speaker.

``Janha, could you remind me what time the group of `Selected Recruits' is
expected?''

``In a quarter of an hour, sir, when they finish their tour.''

``I'd rather not receive any calls until then. I'm pressed for time. I have to take care of a few things
beforehand.''

``Of course, sir.''

``Thank you, Janha,'' Bonimi hangs up.

Ezlip gets up to leave. ``There's a year and a half to go till next elections,'' he says as if
by the way. ``It occurred to me that you might consider \hbox{running ---''}

So that's what was behind his aide's sycophantic display{ }and his research in  `Who's Who'.
``For what party?'' Bonimi asks.

``Any party would grab you with both hands.''

``I see. Well, there's one angle I wouldn't have to worry about --- who'd run my campaign. Many thanks for
your accolades, but it's out of the question.''

Ezlip waves a hand in the air and leaves the room. He has no doubt that the idea he raised with the CEO~will sooner than
later take root{. }

Bonimi quietly locks the door behind his energetic assistant, returns to his chair, takes a slip of paper from his
wallet, glances at it and dials.~ After several rings the receiver is picked up at the other end with an absent-minded
``Hello ---''

``Hello Shouba,'' he says, ``It's Bonimi ---''

``Oh{\ldots}I'm sorry{\ldots}I mean, hello Boni ---'' Shouba collects himself.

``Am I interrupting?''

``No, of course not ---''

``Maybe you have something on the burner ---''

``The burner?'' Shouba is slow on the uptake. ~``Oh, I see ---'' he
chuckles. ``No, I've nothing on it at the moment ---''

``I wanted to tell you that they've given you a license to work with materials of B and C
categories.''

``But I didn't ask{\ldots}'' Shouba is certain about this. He wouldn't ask Boni for anything
for himself.

``Yours truly did it behind your back.''

``Really{\ldots}'' Shouba is deeply moved, ``Oh,~Boni ---''

``They'll mail the license to your home address. There'll be some forms to fill of course. Anyhow, I wanted
to be the bearer of good tidings.''

``Thank you,'' Shouba, finally focused, feels he has to be more than grateful.
``I so appreciate the trouble you've taken on my behalf.''

``No trouble at all. I was happy to do it. Two phone calls all in all. Apparently ten years ago
they'd cancelled some obsolete requirements.''

``I should have inquired myself.''

``Now all this is behind us.''

`Behind us', thinks Shouba. Boni does resemble Saffia in a way. He too radiates human warmth. Not gushing like
Saffia's. Still, it's there. ``It'll change my life.''

``What's the use of wasted talents, right?''

``In other words, I have a license!'' Receiver in hand Shouba cavorts like a drunken bear.

``I believe that that's in fact what I'm trying to tell you.''

``I'm a slow learner. And while we're at it{\ldots}Alir popped in last week. Exhilarated isn't the word!
That too is thanks to you. Boni, you're brilliant!''

``And you're not annoyed with me for what I said~about the overnight permit for that Balad ---''

``Of course not.'' Truth{ }was, he'd actually been more than annoyed with Boni
telling him he was playing with fire when he asked for his help to get thet overnight pass for
that{ }Balad. But he must now put that aside.

Bonimi clears his throat before asking, with some hesitation, ``Is there any{\ldots}news?''

``What news?''

``When I speak to you I can't help thinking about~old times{\ldots}is there{\ldots}\linebreak[0]any word about{\ldots}Rimat?''

``I told you that after the tragedy she severed all ties.''

``If you hear anything ---''

``Not a chance. She won't make contact. Never.''

``Why?''

``She blamed me for what happened to Saffia{\ldots}Insisting that the bomb-timers I made for him were
defective.''

``She cut off all ties with me too. She blamed me too.''

``For what?''

``For the fact that the pump wasn't fixed on the bike. That I kept it under my bed.''

``Ah, yes. Now I remember your pump,'' says Shouba --- something rings a bell. ``It was the best that money
could buy.''

{}``We both saved up for it. It belonged to both of us. But I liked to keep it under my bed. And Saffia~being Saffia,
didn't mind. Rimat was different.''

\chapter{}

This is the fourth night. Won't she come tonight either? Glin is frantic. Perhaps~Black Mother objects to her going out
alone at night? And she had no way of letting him know? He turns on the Walkman hoping the music will help, but it does
for only one short minute. He's too strung up. He peers outside. It's already dark. Then suddenly there's a rustle in
the bushes. Aera! He runs up to her, wraps his arms around her. She wriggles out of his embrace and starts diving back
to the mouth of the cave, intending to leave.

 He chases her, catches up with her. ``What happened?''

``Something terrible ---''

``Nothing terrible could have happened if you're here ---''

``What happened is terrible-terrible-terrible ---''

Glin's heart freezes. He puts his hands over his ears.

Aera pulls them away. ``I must tell and you must listen ---''

``I don't want to ---''

Aera locks his hands in hers, keeping them away from his ears. Only one thought has kept her going since the
Act:  to share it with Glin. \textit{He must listen! }

``\textit{You} can know about terrible things. \textit{I cannot}.''

``That man, from the village{\ldots}He didn't die naturally. He was made to die.''

Glin tries to free himself from Aera's grip, but her hands are stronger.

``\textit{I} \textit{did it}. I pushed him onto the iron peg. On purpose. Shouldn't I be made to
die?''

``Aera ---'' Glin drowns in a wave of nausea.

``I should pay the penalty!''

Glin feels suffocated. ``Aera ---'' he pleads, not knowing what to say.

``I should be punished!'' Aera remembers hearing of a woman who went mad because of one
thought she could not shake off. Is this what's going to happen to her?

Glin steadies himself, ``It wouldn't bring Moshko back to life,'' he says.

``But I must pay the price.''

``Enough,'' begs Glin, ``no more.''

``It haunts me{\ldots}It'll haunt me to my dying day.''

``You will not die. Never.''

``I want to die now --- or I'll go crazy!''

``No-no-no!''

``I should go to the people in your village and confess, `It was because of me that the guard
died'.''

``No way! Don't you dare!''

Aera lets go of Glin's hands. She feels herself sinking. ``I won't go down there even if you tell me to. I
don't want to \textit{be}. But I do want to \textit{live}. Save me from myself!''

``I saw it happen.'' Glin wants to embrace her but she doesn't let him. ``That
evening I was standing near the window like I always do. Watching you and your mother going out through the gate,
walking and singing into the sunset. And I thought I saw Moshko fall down. And then he seemed to get up. Now I
understand. It was \textit{you} who got up. How could you go in and out with the gate already locked?''

``I slid under the fence. Won't you ask me why I did it?''

``I don't want to.''

``But you must want to know!''

``But I don't{\ldots}'' Glin stammers, ``please let me be ---''

``There was a man who was alive, and suddenly he isn't anymore. Because of me. You must know
why!''

``Moshko was going to die anyhow. He was already so weak, already so old.''

``You're saying a terrible thing. It's forbidden to think this way. Even if that man was one minute away
from dying. I did a terrible thing.''

``Forget it.''

``How can I forget? It's forbidden to forget such a thing. I want to tell you why I did it.''

``I don't want to hear,'' Glin says, ``I'm afraid.''

Aera takes a few steps towards the mouth{ }of the cave intending to leave. Glin blocks her exit,
``Why are you leaving me?''

``If you don't care about what I went through, what I'm going through, what I shall always go through, then{\ldots}''

``Why delve into what's depressing?''

``I cannot do otherwise. I am what I am and you are what you are. We think differently. We feel differently.
We are not destined to be together.'' Again she begins to walk out of the cave.

Glin forces her back. ``Say what you want to say ---''

``That song Mother and I sing, about the Pale Blue Valley. Like I told you. My people --- the Balads --- come
from there. Your people made us leave. Many of us want to go back there, but people on your side say that what happened
in the past is over and done with. ~They say \textit{they }live there now. That there's no place there for us~anymore.
And your side is stronger than ours. So your side has the upper hand. And there're people among us who say that we
mustn't give in. That it's possible to make your side let us return. How? By frightening your side. By threats. Bombs.
Killings. More threats. More bombs. More killings. Until in the end your side will give in. And whoever wants to belong
to those who think this way must prove that he himself is capable of~doing such things ---''

``You too?''

``I belong with these people. It's my family. It's my relatives. My friends. When I was small, people of
your side killed my father and my brothers and my sisters. My mother hid with me. She stopped my mouth with her hand so
my crying wouldn't be heard. This is how we survived. She and I and a cousin of mine. And ever since then we've been
wandering from place to place.''

``Did this happen in Pale Blue Valley?''

``Yes. But I was too small to remember. I don't remember Pale Blue Valley. ~But because of mother's
stories, it's as if I remember it{\ldots}If only I had not done this terrible thing! It's a curse.''

``What you did, you did for a great~ideal.'' Glin, aroused by{ }the ideal, proclaims,
``That's how you should see it.''

``It's a terrible ideal.''

``No. It's a perfect ideal. Like a perfect piece of~music. What you told me about Pale Blue Valley's name.
That it got its name from those pale blue flowers that bloom in that valley only one hour, early in the morning and
only for one week in the year{\ldots}It's unique like a unique piece of
music{\ldots}And this desire to return there{\ldots}It's
like a musical theme{\ldots}So magical that you want to hear it over and over again, you want it to echo in your
ears forever ---''

``You shouldn't make somebody die for a piece of music ---''

``You have to forget it,'' Glin is suddenly filled with resolve.

``But I can't.''

``If you carry on like this, you'll make me die too.
Make{ }yourself{ }imagine that it wasn't you. That it was somebody else, somebody else
who is no more.'' Glin takes her in his arms and now feels her warm response.

``So tell me who I am ---'' Aera feels her body giving in to his embrace.

``You are who's here with me now. In my arms.''

She repeats his words as though quoting a coded message, ``I am who's here with you. In your
arms.''

It can't be put off any longer, Glin knows. It's time to tell her.
\hbox{``Listen ---''}

Aera senses the slight change in his voice. ``When?'' Until now she was afraid to know the
exact date of his departure.

``Tomorrow morning.''

She was not prepared for the tears that are filling her eyes, the pain crushing~her heart. She asks. ``Were
you ever in love?''

``So many times,'' Glin answers. ``But I'm not in love now. I'm in something else
now. Now I'm in something that has no words. Only music.''

``Aren't you going to ask me the same question?''

Glin kisses her fingers one by one, ``How do you divide one soul into two halves?''

Aera says, ``Letters~could keep us together.''

``Where should I address them to? This cave?''

``There's a new shopping mall in town,'' Aera repeats Yamik's words as if they are her own.
``Just opposite the supermarket there's an apartment building on the left that has three entrances. Next
to the middle entrance there's a sign --- `Center for Aid'. It's for us Balads. Leave the letters there. Write `Care of
Yamik for Aera' on the envelope.''

``Who's Yamik?''

``The cousin I mentioned before. He works for a contractor in town. He sometimes goes to that Center to
pick up things or drop things off.~ He'll bring me your letters. And we'll only write simple things. As if we just
happen to know each other. Because this cousin is nosy. He'll open the letters and read them. I'll understand between
the lines.''

``Let's just draw straight lines with a ruler and leave the spaces in between empty,'' Glin
suggests.

Aera laughs. ~Glin's humor revives her. His wit was what first drew her to him. It was something new for her, something
different, exciting.

``Your laughter sounds like a tinkling bell,'' Glin says.

``Mother says I inherited it from her ---''

``When the two of you laugh together it must sound like the peal of a pair of bells ---''

``I don't remember Mother laughing. I was too small then. She stopped laughing after our
tragedy.''

After a moment's silence Glin says, ``I have a memento for you ---''

``Don't give me any memento.''

``Why?''

``Nobody should see anything of yours around me.''

Glin wheels over the old cradle from deeper in the cave ``I was a baby in this,'' he says,
``and when I outgrew it my mom made it her sewing basket. She decided not to take it with
us.''

``A memento of a memento. I'll tell Mother that I picked it up at the flea market. And what shall I give
you as a memento in return?''

``The very fact that you're taking from me something that I saw every day of my life. In both my conscious
and unconscious life.''

``Oh ---'' a desperate moan bursts from Aera's heart. ``When will we meet
again?''

``Soon.'' Glin holds her close, kisses her. ``Soon. And then we'll be together
never to part. We'll think about it with all our might and it'll happen.'' He strokes her hair, caresses
it with his lips. ``In the whole wide world~no hair shines like yours.''

``I'll never do anything like that again. Never.''

Glin soothes her, ``Sh{\ldots}''

``I'll only do good things.''

``Sh{\ldots}''

``You said before, `Moshko was going to die anyhow. He was already so weak, already so old.' Say you're
sorry about those terrible words, that you don't think like that anymore ---''

Glin does her bidding, ``I'm sorry. I don't think like that anymore.'' He spreads a blanket on
the floor. ``Listen ---'' he turns on the Walkman.

An ancient melody transforms the cave into a haven.

\chapter{}

``But I've no experience whatsoever,'' Alir says dispiritedly.

Shouba encourages him, ``Trust Boni. He knows what he's doing. He wouldn't have offered you this without
good reason.''

Shouba doesn't make light of Alir's misgivings. He too doubts whether Alir is competent to MC a public ceremony
broadcast on radio and TV. For the life of him he would never have dreamt~that Boni would come up with this idea when
he'd asked him if he could find a slot in his field of operation for their poet friend. But once it became clear that
this was Boni's decision he most certainly didn't question it. First, because the very thought of doubting a decision
made by an expert was not like him; second, because he trusted Boni's judgment. And third, if the ceremony would go
well, part of that success would be attributed to Alir as its MC, and this could open up prospects for him --- something
he sorely needs.

``Boni is too good to me,'' Alir says thoughtfully.

``Why wouldn't he be? Didn't the two of you share that glass veranda in the old days?
Feet-to-feet?''

``What does that have to do with me standing before a~hall full of people?'' Alir shudders.

``We'll practice,'' Shouba reassures him, ``try it out.''

``Your scientific approach,'' Alir grins desperately.

``Don't underrate it,'' Shouba responds. ``I'll be the audience. We'll do it
again and again until you feel confident and spontaneous. Until it becomes second nature to you.''

Alir shrugs. ``Do you remember~Boni's days as a milkman?'' He asks.

``Oh, that's right!'' Shouba bursts out excitedly. ``I all but forgot that ---''

``I wrote a poem about him then. I wrote that when he delivers milk, the sky is milky hue and heavenly
white flakes drop gently into the milk. `Heavenly White Flakes'. This was the title of the poem. Who knows whether Boni
remembers it. I'm too embarrassed to ask him. But in my mind he'll forever be associated with that poem.''
Alir remembers he had written it in his first notebook of poems which is stashed somewhere among his other notebooks
nobody is interested in ``Boni has a scar on his left cheek,'' he says, ``I
don't recall that he had it then. Do you?''

``Neither do I,'' Shouba agrees.  He had in fact noticed that scar the moment Boni appeared
at his front door when he had invited him for the purpose of asking him whether he could do something for Alir. But
that t\^ete-\`a-t\^ete was of course kept secret from the poet. ``On the contrary,'' he says.
``How well I remember~his smooth chubby cheeks. Who knows how he ever got a scar like
that ---'' After a minute he adds tenderly, ``I loved the way he and~Saffia called each other
Big-Saff and Li'l-Saff ---''

Alir's ears still reverberate with Rimat's shrieks as she burst into the glass veranda.  `Boni! Saffia's gone
out! Did you give him the pump? \textit{Did you}?' It was still pitch dark. He heard Boni grab the pump from under his
bed and bolt outside with it. And he, scared to death, turned~to the wall, pretending to be asleep.



\chapter{}

Was the cacophony in the cafeteria always that unbearable? Or maybe he'd forgotten? ~Listening to his~old colleagues
expressing their remarks, observations, associations, memories, Zakod~feels once again that this place is no longer
what it used to be --- his real home. Since his resignation eight years ago after the tragedy, this is the feeling that
engulfs him whenever he is tempted to accept those invitations sent to him automatically by the university secretariat
to lectures, symposiums, colloquiums, receptions, ceremonies and what not. Especially so if the day happens
to coincide with his weekly shopping trip into town.

``Who's that?'' he tilts his head in the direction of a man who has just picked up a tray at
the head of the buffet line and is now collecting his plate and cutlery. ``His face is familiar ---''

``That's the ex-ex Chief-of-Staff,'' answers colleague number one.

``Oh, I did not recognize him,'' Zakod says, ``probably because he is~not in
uniform.''

``He appears on TV as a commentator on issues of defense and security,'' says colleague number
two, immediately adding --- not to embarrass their erstwhile colleague --- ``quite rarely, actually. He'll
speak after the break.''

``What about?'' Zakod is interested. On receiving the invitation to this particular symposium
he had thrown it into the waste paper basket after a quick glance and only committed the date to memory.

Colleague number two responds, ``{\thinspace}`The Balad Problem --- Background, Reasons, Resolutions,
Implications.'\thinspace''

A handful, Zakod says to himself, recalling that it was this very topic that had intrigued him and aroused his curiosity
when he had glanced at the invitation. When they{ }came{ }to
the Questions-and-Answers{, }he saw himself standing up and asking, ``Why call it `The
Balad Problem'? Why not `We and the Balads --- Our Mutual Problem'?'' He had hoped that by the time~this
symposium{ }took place he would~formulate a cohesive body of ideas about this topic and be ready to
express them. But then he had forgotten all about it and only remembered that he would not mind attending.
``Who is chairing that session?'' he asks his colleagues.

``Yours truly,'' colleague number one raises a finger and adds, ``there're~rumors
about detailed operational plans stashed in the famous `drawer' to drive them out.''

Colleague number one raises an eyebrow, ``Come to think of it, it's been quiet lately on that front ---''

Colleague number two raises both eyebrows, ``Undoubtedly they're waiting for the
right~moment.''

``{\thinspace}`They' of which side?'' Zakod asks nonchalantly.

The two colleagues grimace jointly.

Colleague number one is the first to return to the topic at hand, ``Does anyone have any idea about the
line of policy in that famous `drawer{}'?''

Colleague number two responds, ``To do it quickly, decisively and elegantly. In areas where there are large
concentrations of them, first try to persuade them by messages via the media, by leaflets, and such. Buses will be put
at their disposal to cross the border.''

Colleague number one asks, ``And if they refuse to cooperate?''

The expression on colleague number two's face reflects his doubts at the prospects. Colleague number one comments with a
worried look, ``There's well-founded information about live ammunition being
stockpiled among\linebreak[4] them.''

``They don't have a chance in a frontal confrontation,'' colleague number two maintains.

A waitress appears, ``Gentlemen, is there anything else you'd like?''

``A glass of water, please,'' responds colleague number one. Colleague number two and Zakod
raise their hands for the same.

Colleague number two carries on, ``Food, water, blankets, medicine, toys for children will be provided for
them. ~And only specially trained soldiers --- of both sexes --- will take part in this operation.''

Colleague number one is interested, ``What'll happen to them across the border?''

``They'll be the problem across the border ---'' colleague number two smiles.

The~waitress reappears and puts three glasses of water on the table. They all thank her. She asks hesitantly,
``And{\ldots}the bill?''

Colleague number two says, ``It'll be for all of us together, please.''

Colleague number one gathers that she's wondering about Zakod. Not being a habitu\'e in the cafeteria she doesn't
recognize him. He explains: ``Our guest is an emeritus professor of the university.'' Once
the waitress disappears he wonders aloud, ``Why isn't it possible to come to terms with them in that area
called Pale Blue Valley? To some extent, at least?''

``First of all, what do you mean by `to some extent'?'' colleague number two flares up.
``And secondly, how would you extract those of us who have already been living there for years and years?
Just to think about the compensations they'd demand. And rightly so. And third, the precedent it would set. There'd be
no end to Balads claiming that a grandfather of theirs had once lived up in the north and a great-great-grandmother of
theirs had once lived down in the south. All the way back to Adam and Eve.''

``Not necessarily,'' colleague number one responds coolly. To relieve the tension that has
begun to threaten their serene academic threesome, he decides to steer the conversation to another topic and turns to
Zakod, ``It occurs to me that you might know Professor Michlor Nissen, a member of the International
Medical Society Acting Committee, who is going to participate in the discussion.''

``Yes,'' responds Zakod, ``we once knew each other.'' He's shocked.
How could he have failed to notice old Michlor's name on the invitation? He feels awkward about meeting  him face to
face. He never responded to his letter of condolence after the tragedy.

``But I heard that he asked to have his name removed from the list of participants,'' says
colleague number two.

``Oh,'' Zakod is not displeased to learn. It doesn't only have to do with the fact that he
failed to respond to Michlor's letter of condolence. It also relates to the painful chapter in both their lives that
centers around Saffia.

``The Dean's secretary told me they'd received a cable from him saying he's flying with disaster-relief
forces to{ }that godforsaken area hit by that terrible hurricane. He'll be organizing there an
emergency children's hospital there.''

``The man is a saint,'' says Zakod lowering his head. He'd rather not confront the pitying
eyes of the two colleagues.

Colleague number two asks him, ``Weren't the two of you connected to a man who was killed in a still
mysterious accident during the so-called `Phony Occupation'?''

``We were,'' Zakod answers laconically.

``What was that man's name?'' asks colleague number one.

Zakod is conflicted. If he says he forgot, what will they think --- that he's losing it?{ }That he is
suffering from a cognitive decline? Or that for some reason he would rather not spell out Saffia's name? That the
question~embarrasses him? He says, ``Saffia. Saffia Saffia.''

``The idea was doomed to fail from the start,'' colleague number one maintains, ``but is still
interesting. It could be the basis for several doctoral theses. Do you have any material on the subject?''


``Nothing in writing. Everything was oral then.'' The words lie heavily on Zakod's lips. He
knows how unconvincing he sounds, which is why he adds, ``Also, I had not had much contact with Saffia
Saffia before his plans crystallized into action.'' However feeble this may sound, it is the honest truth.
But the only person who could ever believe it was his own self.

Colleague number two tries to clarify the point, ``Did it have to do with differences of opinion about the
purpose? The considerations? The means?''

``Hard to differentiate.'' Zakod gets up with a forced ironic smile. ``Pardon me,
gentlemen, but I have to verify something on the bulletin board.''

Colleague number one waits until Zakod is out of earshot. ``That tragedy devastated him,'' he
murmurs with feeling. ``He threw his life's career to the winds.  He's not his old self.''

Colleague number two also speaks from his heart, ``To go into farming at that age. Sad. If not downright
preposterous.''

{}``I'm always uncomfortable about~meeting him~face to face,'' colleague number one says, ``What can we talk about? More
crucial, what shouldn't we talk about?''

``What you said to him about~the `Phony Occupation',{}'' suggests colleague number two, ``that it could be
a subject for numerous doctoral theses ---''

``I thought it might draw him back to academic life,'' colleague number one interrupts him, ``I feel so bad
about his horrible predicament.''

``I have a student who might fancy it for his doctorate,'' says colleague number two, ``I could ask him
whether he'd be ready to meet with him.''

``Excellent idea,'' colleague number one~nods in agreement.

``There's the bell!'' says his colleague. ``Where is he? I don't see him?''

{}``He's disappeared,'' Colleague number one says. ``And perhaps he decided to make himself
scarce altogether.''

\chapter{}

Seeing Yamik appear up the hill. Mother runs out to greet him: ``Congratulations! Showers of
blessings!''

They embrace. He leans his head on her bosom.

Tears long-forgotten sting her eyes as she strokes his head.  ``God bless you and keep you, my son!''

``Why the tears, auntie?'' Yamik, all innocence, wants the reason spelled out.

Mother cries out to the star-studded heavens. ``Because of our boundless joy!'' After a
moment she calls out to her daughter in the shack, ``Aera! Our man is here! The
father-to-be!''

Aera pulls her headscarf tighter and brings herself to the doorway.

With a few quick strides Yamik covers the distance between them. He puts one arm round her shoulders, his other hand on
her belly. ``My Aera ---'' he whispers holding her close, covering her with kisses. Then he
takes her to the~bench outside and sits her down next to him. After a moment he reaches for the knot of her kerchief
and unties it. He remains speechless as the kerchief slides down to reveal his beloved's newly shorn head.
``Why?'' he murmurs painfully.

``It's so unbearably hot,'' Aera says in a colorless voice. That hurdle is thankfully behind
her.

``I guess you know what's best for you ---'' Yamik sympathizes.

Aera retrieves her kerchief from Yamik's hands to cover her head again.

Mother~feels better. The moment she so dreaded is over. The first time she saw that terrible thing her daughter had done
a week ago she was aghast. She too got that flat response, `It's so unbearably hot.' She'd immediately thought about
Yamik~who could never wait to caress Aera's abundance of shining hair. And that apathetic tone somehow matched Aera's
lusterless eyes when she'd told her about her pregnancy. She wasn't like a woman thrilled to share good tidings. Why
isn't she overjoyed the way she ought to be? Because of our sad Balad lot, Mother tells herself, trying to believe it.
 Now she lets herself ignore Aera's despondency and asks her, ``Did you cook? Did you bake? Did you
prepare food for the husband? For the father-to-be?'' She turns to Yamik, explaining, ``A
woman thinks only of herself and of what's inside her when it's her first time.''

``I didn't cook,'' says Aera. ``I didn't bake and I didn't prepare food for the
husband. For the father-to-be.'' She doesn't add `Because he isn't together with me nor am I together with
him.' She feels Mother's eyes boring into her. Is she conveying her troubled feelings to Mother wordlessly? Her
heart goes out to her. ``Were you like me?'' she asks her, ``lazy and tired and heavy?''

``I don't remember,'' Mother evades the question and hastens indoors. How well she does
remember! When first time pregnant she became much more agile, much more alert, seven times more eager to take upon
herself any chore.

Aera says, ``But I do.'' She's not sure Mother, by now indoors, has heard.

Clearly she has, for she floats a question from the kitchen alcove, ``My little wild one, how can you
remember things that happened before you were born?''

``Because you told me about them yourself. I remember your stories. I live inside them. They've become mine
too.''

Mother appears outside again. Aera rushes to her crying, ``Mother dearest!'' She nestles in
her arms as if seeking shelter. Mother holds her close, turning her eyes to Yamik who looks perplexed. She tries to hint
that this is one of those moods a woman has when she's with child.



\chapter{}

The contractor unlocks the front door. ``Welcome,'' he says as he shows Yamik in.
``There's nobody home.''

Not long after this most reliable Balad started working for him, he let slip something about his wife and children
being `open-minded{}'. But until now,~whenever they stopped by his home, he'd gaze into space and mumble something
about having to drop in for a second and that he'd be right back. ~This is therefore~the first time that his Balad
foreman has entered his home.

``Make yourself comfortable,'' he indicates an upholstered chair in the hall.

``With these?'' Yamik points to his dusty overalls.

The fact that this is also obvious to the contractor proves that despite his wish to behave matter-of-factly he certainly
doesn't feel comfortable. He goes to the kitchen and returns with a plastic chair, a glass of water and some cookies,
``Help yourself ---'' he offers the refreshment to his foreman with a smile and then goes to
the adjoining room leaving the door ajar. He leafs through a stack of papers, opens and closes
drawers. ``How are the cookies?'' he asks Yamik from the other room.

Yamik realizes the question is the contractor's way of keeping an eye on him,
as if by remote control. He responds,
``With all due respect, they're nowhere near ours.''

The contractor enjoys Yamik's spontaneity and responds in kind, ``You have the advantage over us. People
who wander from place to place adopt the best of wherever they happen to be and then improve on it.''

``The full half-cup.''

An apt retort, the contractor thinks, and responds, ``A healthy attitude. And here at last are the
building plans.''

Upstairs a door opens and is followed by footsteps descending down. Yamik springs to his feet. The contractor obviously
hears those steps too and hurries back to the hall, the roll of building plans under his arm.

``Ouli!''  The contractor stretches his free hand towards a young man in a khaki undershirt
and slacks,{ }a dog-tag hanging from his neck.

``Dad!'' the young man smiles as they embrace.

``When did you get in?''

``Late morning ---''

``Ma knows you've come?''

``She was just on her way out when I arrived.''

``How are you, son?''

``I was dead tired. Just took a nap.''

``Back to bed, then ---''

``No way. I have to get to the university.''

The contractor throws an arm across Ouli's shoulder and swivels him towards Yamik, ``This is Ouli, my
eldest son. Meet Yamik, my right-hand man.'' Ouli and Yamik exchange a nod. The contractor's eyes move
back and forth between them. They get the hint and their hands meet for a polite~handshake.

``Let~me raid the fridge,'' Ouli says, disappearing into the kitchen.

This is what normal family life looks like, thinks Yamik. Father, mother, children, proper home, furniture, appliances.
Day following day rationally, assuredly.

``We'll soon be off,'' the contractor tells Yamik, unrolling one of the plans and scrutinizing
it. He doesn't invite him to sit down again, but he would dearly like Ouli to cut short his visit to the fridge and
join them in the hall.

Ouli reappears as if sensing his father's wish, in one hand a cold drink, in the other a bowl of nuts. He smiles at
Yamik, ``Does my father exploit his workers? You can tell me. I know the kind of man he
is.''

Yamik smiles back, ``He exploits his workers same as he exploits himself.''

``No discrimination, right?'' Ouli is full of good cheer.

``None whatsoever,'' Yamik agrees.

The three of them share a laugh.

The contractor turns to his son, ``Will you come home after the lecture?''

``Unfortunately no,'' Ouli answers. ``I have to rush back.''

``What's so urgent?''

Ouli gulps down his drink, surprised that his father would ask such a question in front of a Balad. Where's the man
living? Doesn't he know how things are?

``Would you mind putting this in the truck?'' the contractor turns to Yamik, handing him the roll of building plans,
``I'll be along in a minute.''

Yamik and Ouli wave each other goodbye. Yamik departs.

``When's your next leave?'' the contractor asks his son.

``Depends on the situation,'' Ouli answers, having decided not to comment on his
father's indiscretion.

``Time to go,'' the contractor says, and embracing his son adds, ``And don't
forget to be careful.''

``\textit{You} be careful ---'' Ouli echoes.

``You mean that Balad guy?'' The contractor asks dismissively. ``He's such a
solid character.''

``So be \textit{extra} careful ---''

The contractor waves away his son's apprehension.~ ``Not to worry. He won't get involved in any nonsense.
He's too level-headed. And he's married with a baby on the way. It's only thanks to him that I could take on the
renovation in the TV building. On top of the Eastern Hills Project it's quite a load. But I took it because it'll give
me a foot in the door for other projects. I'm also thinking of your future.''

``I appreciate it, dad,'' Ouli smiles. ``There was a big write-up in the papers
about this renovation.''

``I saw it and told Yamik about it,'' the contractor says, ``and he said that my
name should appear among the credits on the program as the renovation's contractor.''

``Absolutely. And his?'' Ouli realizes that his father is looking for an answer and adds,
``A bad joke, I admit. And how are things coming along in that Eastern Hills project?''

``Nicely. But they're threatening to land us a `Work Cessation Order'. Some kind of~legal point~has cropped
up. This is the bad news. The good news is that I'm meeting the schedule I'm committed to with the renovation job.  I
have Yamik to thank for that. For the past few weeks we switched. He's in charge of the auditorium while I take care of
the Eastern Hills project. But there's a bit of bad news. Yamik has found another job closer to his family, which means
that unfortunately, very-very unfortunately, he's leaving me. But not before we finish the auditorium job. He
promised me, and you can count on him.''

``His command of our language is pretty impressive,'' Ouli says. ``It's only his
accent that gives his Balad origins away.''

``That's how it is with those we work with ---''

``One reason to be extra careful.''

``I am,'' the contractor smiles, ``don't you worry.''



\chapter{}

Every movement she makes is so precise, so perfect --- thinks Dela --- feeling Rimat's hands gently lowering her head onto
the pillow and tucking the blanket around her. Rimat then pulls up a chair next to the bed, sits down and holds her
hand while she says, ``Goodnight Moiku, goodnight Blaya, goodnight Tiqvi, sweet dreams.''

Dela is sure Rimat can visualize the scene she has described to her: their old home, the lamp on Zakod's desk in his
study throwing a beam of soft light into the girls{'} room, their three beds, three desks, exercise books, reading
books, pencils, crayons strewn on each, a bookcase~full of board games, dolls, albums, books, knick-knacks. Each girl
breathes in her own rhythm, the three rhythms weave into one melodious hum that fills her heart.

Every night Rimat tiptoes out of Dela's bedroom engulfed with this scene. She goes to the kitchen which opens onto the
living room.  Zakod is dozing off in his armchair in front of mute images~gliding across the TV screen. She picks up
her embroidery from the bottom shelf of the kitchen cupboard. Tonight, hopefully, she'll add another flower or two to
the unfinished garland.

``Rimat?'' Zakod is awake.

``Yes?''

``Is Dela asleep?''

``She is.''

``Is the garbage ready for me to take out?''

``I've already emptied it.''

``Have we not agreed that \textit{that} shall be my task? Why did you not wake me up?''

``I like to get my hands into garbage.''

``As a punishment, come over here and take a look.''

A short time after she had arrived he told her that he had stopped taking any interest in what was happening in the
world. Still, every once in a while he draws her attention to items in the newspaper, on the radio, on television ---
when it works. Is it because he wants to draw her back to life? And thus --- vicariously --- draw \textit{himself} back
into life? She puts down her embroidery and comes over to him.

``Look ---'' Zakod points at the screen.

``What's this?''

``A troupe of clowns,'' he says, turning up the volume. An oleaginous voice is heard,
``And therefore, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow citizens, in these demanding times it behooves
us{\ldots}'' Zakod turns the sound off.

``A comedy act?'' Rimat asks and in a moment gets the point.~The two of them share~a laugh.
``Who are they really?'' Rimat asks.

``Your Prime Minister, your Defense Minister, your Minister of the Interior, your Minister of Foreign
Affairs ---''

``They're yours, too,'' Rimat interrupts.

``After the news there's an hour of sing-along.''

``I don't sing anymore.''

``The two of you were~always singing,'' Zakod reminisces, ``in unison, in two
parts. I once joined in and you clapped your hands and said, `You're so off key, my standing ovation!'\thinspace''

``How Saffia berated me afterwards!  `How can you~insult someone like that!' Anyway{\ldots}I can't sing
anymore.''

``Cannot?''

``Ever since{\ldots}no voice comes out. When Glin was small I couldn't even sing him a
lullaby.''

Zakod is thinking about things abruptly~excised from life. Surgery without anesthetics. ``But~your Glin is
so very much into music,'' he says softly

``He was like that already as a baby. And it became more and more so as he got older and wanted to listen
to music on the radio or the gramophone. I told him then that music gives me a headache. The inventions of Walkman and
earphones solved the problem. But it was only when he showed no interest in playing Saffia's violin that my heart
could rest easy.''

``Why does he think that Saffia died of heart failure?''

``It's not\textit{ untrue}, is it? I didn't want him to know what his father had done. Since the beginning,
right from infancy in fact, I tried to teach him that bombs and killing and wars and armies are terrible. To abhor all
of them. I wanted to protect and guard~what~Saffia left me for safe-keeping. And I lied to you. Glin doesn't have any
disability. He's completely healthy. ~It was because he listened to me that he became a conscientious objector and
could thus avoid conscription.''

Zakod is impressed, ``I am proud of him!''

``Really?''

``Really.''

``I didn't know you were that way inclined.''

``Have you forgotten all the rows that Saffia and I had?''

``How could anyone?  But I thought that by now{\ldots}you'd have changed your mind ---''

``Because of our tragedy?'' Zakod takes her hand which she can't refuse. ``The
tragedy did not change my mind. It only strengthened it.'' He turns off the television altogether. The
screen becomes~a flat metallic grey.

Except for a hazy beam of light coming{ }from the kitchen Rimat and
Zakod are in semi-darkness.

``Since we're into telling all kinds of truths,'' Rimat says, ``why didn't you
tell Dela that we know each other from way back?''

``To save her more suffering. Had I told her, her pain about the void in our marriage would be
worse.''

Rimat gets up to leave.

Zakod follows her. ``It is the same with me as ever,'' he says.

``No, no ---'' Rimat makes for the basement door.

Zakod bars her way. ``For a while I had an arrangement with a small hotel in town on the weekly shopping
day. The condition was that she should not be young nor pretty and absolutely quiet. Preferably dumb. ~Once there was a
mishap --- the same one came again. I had not foreseen this predicament. It was then that I stopped. Who else in the
world can I tell this to?''



\chapter{}

Glin leaves the Center, his heart pounding --- a letter from Aera in his hand! He wouldn't of course open it in the
presence of the kind man who runs the Center. He'll cross the street. There's some shade there next to the brick wall.
He'll lean against it and open the letter without being disturbed by pedestrians or passing cars. He's already there
when a handsome well built young man approaches him,

``Glin?'' Yamik asks, extending his hand.

``Indeed,'' Glin answers and feels the stranger's eyes fixed on the envelope in his hand.

``I'm Yamik. Aera's cousin.''

``Oh,'' Glin shakes Yamik's hand. For one moment he feels he should return the letter to him.


``Aera would like you to know that she's well,'' Yamik says. ``Very
well.''

``You're a courier for words written and oral?''

``That is so.''

``Then please tell her that I too am well. Very well.~ I've just left a letter for her at the
Center.''

``I'll be there in a minute,'' Yamik looks Glin over. Aera had described him accurately. He's
skinny with a Walkman and earphones hanging down from his neck. There's a certain naivet\'e about him. He's obviously
crazy about Aera. Could he really prove to be of some help like she says? ``Nice to meet you. Maybe it
wouldn't be a bad idea for us to exchange a few words.''

``About what?'' Glin can't suppress his curiosity.

``About what's on Aera's mind,'' Yamik answers

``You mean the Pale Blue Valley?'' Glin asks.

``The very same ---'' answers Yamik and looks around. ``But this calls for
somewhere less busy, less noisy, less open.''

Glin is excited.  Aera's courier wants to have a talk with him! That will surely strengthen the bond between them!
``I live not far from here at the western edge of town,'' he says, ``on a farm
belonging to a man called Zakod.''

Yamik smiles and asks ``Should I knock on the door and introduce myself, `I'm Yamik. Yes. You guessed
right, I'm a Balad. Glin and I are~friends. Can I speak with him?{}'\thinspace''

``Every day around noon I move some irrigation pipes from here to there at the far end of the farm,''
explains Glin. ``There's a row of cypresses there. ~In the middle there's an old fig tree. It's now in
leaf.''

``With plenty of shade under it,'' Yamik continues~amiably.

``I'll be there tomorrow around noon ---''

``We'll wait there for each other,'' Yamik smiles, ``depending on who gets there
first.''

Once again he extends a hand towards Glin for a handshake. Glin responds. Yamik places his left hand on their two
clasped hands. Glin covers it with his. The letter held between his fingers hovers like a white dove over their clasped
hands.

\chapter{}

Shisha puts her hands over her ears to shut out the terrible racket all around, careful not to smudge her fresh red nail
polish or --- God forbid! --- get some of it on her hairdo. ``How much longer do we have to suffer
this?'' she complains to the elderly security guard.

He was pensioned off a year ago but the powers that be rehired him on special terms since he's so very experienced. As
far as Shisha is concerned his intuition was right. Her provocative dress and heavy makeup are misleading. Inside she's
a good girl. He can tell. He's forever drawn to her information desk.

Shisha doesn't feel that he's flirting with her ---  he's old enough to be her father. But his hanging around her all
the time does get on her nerves. Still, it has its advantages. She's new to the job and he fills her in about the
different people in the building and their various functions. He certainly helps her get her bearings.

``Nothing we can do about it,'' the grey-haired guard shakes his head, ``just a
bit more patience and it'll all be over.''

``At first I was very excited about the renovation,'' Shisha admits. ``It was
like those pictures of `before' and `after' over there ---'' with her chin she indicates the exhibit at the
entrance to the lobby mounted a few days ago. The elderly guard had explained it all to her --- the way the TV building
looked in the past and how it had changed over the years. It was also interesting to see pictures of people who work in
the building --- the way they look now and how they looked when they were young, even as chubby babies.
``But I never thought it would mean this kind of hell. The dust, the dirt, the mess,'' she
says, blowing on her sparkling nail polish. ``Do you think they'll finish in time?''

``Of course they will,'' the elderly guard assures her. ``They've hired a
top-notch contractor.''

``Shhh{\ldots}'' Shisha manages to caution him in time and he hurries back to his post. She
brings out a small mirror from under her desk and checks the contours of her lipstick. Then she straightens her posture
by{ }throwing back her shoulders, and finally thrusts her fingers into her curls~to puff them out. Oh!
The nail polish! She'd forgotten all about it! Hopefully it's already dry. The main thing is that she's ready for the
guide now emerging from the adjacent corridor,~followed by his tour group. He~crosses the lobby and stops at the
exhibit about to address the group. When they're settled around him he begins, ``Ladies and gentlemen,
having toured the TV building and learnt about its various activities, we'll now end our tour by viewing this exhibit --- \textit{Before and After}.''

Shisha has been waiting impatiently for the return of the tour group since it disappeared into the building's bowels an
hour ago. Having not long since broken up with her boyfriend because of a nasty tiff, she fantasizes about a new
romance with this handsome guide. She must find a way to stop him at the end of the tour.

Meanwhile the descending elevator stops at the lobby and people step out. The last to leave are the CEO and his aide. In
a display of shiny red fingernails Shisha waves to the guide to get his attention. ``Mr. ~Bonimi Saffia ---
the CEO,'' she mouths. He gets the message.

Rimat intercepts this inaudible message. Could that~really~be Boni's back? CEO of the Public Television Network? She
tries to remain hidden while not letting him out of sight. He's deep in conversation with the young man by his side.
Suddenly he turns round as if searching for somebody. Herself? Still hidden she manages to get a glimpse of his face.
It's him! He's filled out and grown taller. But where did he get that scar on his cheek? What kind of injury could
that finicky youngster have suffered? Her anger at him has not waned over the years. She hadn't expected to bump into
him when she planned on joining this tour{.} She's here because of
Alir.  Since reading that dreadful poem she's wanted to settle accounts with him. Just as it's thanks to Gidal that
she knows that Boni has been appointed CEO of Public Television, it's thanks to Zakod that she knows that as MC of
the coming{ }inauguration ceremony for the renovated auditorium Alir
has been given a room in the TV building.

After reading out to her that item in the newspaper, Zakod had asked her what she made of it. She'd just shrugged her
shoulders. Because of his and Dela's horrific tragedy she couldn't bring herself to speak with Zakod about Alir's
abominable poem. He might even be unaware of its existence. ``I am a complete ignoramus when it comes to
poetry in general,'' Zakod had added when he told her about Alir's MC appointment, ``but~I
do remember there being something disarmingly candid in his poems''.

And then a day or two later Zakod shared with her another item in the papers --- that Public Television had begun free
guided tours of its premises for the general public. So she'd made arrangements to join this one on the day she does
the weekly shopping in town. Reaching the fourth floor she'd found what she was looking for --- Alir's name on one of the
doors.

The~tour guide thanks Shisha with a meaningful wink, and then gestures to his group to step back and clear the way for
the CEO and his aide. He goes straight up to Bonimi, introduces himself and then says, ``I'm the guide of
this group today, sir. Would it be possible for us to have a look at the~auditorium? Even though it's still under
renovation? Just a quick look?''

``By all means,'' the CEO is happy to oblige. ``Just follow me.''

The young man is delighted. This feat of his will be noted in his CV in the Public Television Network's PR Department.
He blows Shisha a kiss across the lobby. She'll hang onto it.

The elderly guard has also noticed that breezy kiss. \MakeUppercase{A}t the first opportunity he'll warn Shisha against
flirtatious young men. That too is~part of his responsibility.

Before entering the auditorium Bonimi turns his head for another glance at the tour group. No. He was mistaken. No
face there resembles Rimat's.

Ezlip separates the two plastic curtains suspended across the entrance to the auditorium for the duration of the
renovation. Bonimi goes through, followed by Ezlip. The tour guide and his group follow.

Rimat stays hidden at the end of the group. When Security is deep in conversation with the pretty receptionist, she
slips back into the corridor unnoticed.

Shisha remarks to the elderly guard, ``I bet that guide served in one of those elite combat
units.''

He vehemently disagrees. ``After demobilization, those guys find better things to do than shepherd guided
tours in a public building.''

``You can never know,'' Shisha stands her ground. ``Maybe it's just for the time
being.''

Having no convincing argument to the contrary he merely remarks ``I have a picture of myself when I was his
age ---''

Shisha asks, ``Did you also look like a movie star?''

He blushes, the creases in his face turning dark purple. ``So they said.''

``I'm sure you were,'' Shisha gushes over and then asks, ``Tell me, why do they
make such a fuss about security around this entrance?''

The guard is more than happy to provide an exhaustive answer. ``Public Television Network is an arm of
the~government,'' he says, ``I hate to think what could happen if somebody~unauthorized~took
over.''

``What could happen?'' she asks.

``Anything,'' the elderly guard opens his eyes wide.
``Everything.''



\chapter{}

Rimat quickly retraces her steps to the elevator bay, pushes the `UP' button, enters the first available elevator and
presses 4. The second the elevator stops and the door slides open she steps out. She trusts her memory to find the
right room. She knocks on the door. No answer. She carefully opens the door just a crack. Nobody's inside. She closes
the door behind her and takes a look around. The desk is covered with books and brochures. A worn out coat hangs from
a peg on the wall. She guesses that its bulging pockets are stuffed with notes and{ }newspapers
clippings. She guesses right.

Alir enters the room with a handful of papers. ``Sorry,'' he steps back diffidently. Seeing a
strange woman inside he deduces it's the wrong room.

``Alir, you didn't make a mistake,'' Rimat says. ``It's your room.''


``Rimat!'' His papers drop out of his hands onto the floor.~ ``It's so many years
that I've had this daydream --- I open a door and \textit{there you are}!''

``Come in,'' Rimat pulls him inside with one hand and closes the door behind him with the
other.

Alir throws his arms around her, ``Why is it that I can do now what I didn't dare do then?''

``Because all the cells in our bodies have changed hundreds of times ever since then,'' Rimat
answers, ``if not thousands of times.'' She collects the scattered papers and hands them to
Alir. ``But \textit{you} still have papers all over the place as always. Nothing has changed in that
area.'' She pats his hair. ``There's a new color here. Gray, to be exact.''

``But you haven't changed at all!'' Alir exclaims.

``So much so that you didn't recognize me. Poetic license.''

``I can't believe it. I can't.''

``What's there to believe or not to believe?''

``How did you get here? And where from? Why did we disappear from each other all these years? And the baby?
Do you remember how I would grab the cradle with him inside --- grab it by the new handles your friend Gidal
fixed on ---
and spin it round and round? And you'd almost faint from fear? Who does he look like? You? Saffia? Does he play the
violin? How did you find me?''

``My sixth sense,'' Rimat replies.

``Do you know what I'm doing here?''

``I heard about it ---''

``I was in a bad way. Lost the job I had at the school. Don't ask me why. I was drowning in the deepest of
depressions. I would go to Shouba's{\ldots}Remember him?''

Rimat freezes.

Not sensing it Alir continues, ``I'd go to his place and do nothing but sob. Like a baby. And then a phone
call. Out of the bluest of skies. And it's our old Boni who was appointed CEO of the Public Television Network ---
whatever they call it --- asking if I'd be ready to plan the ceremony for the inauguration of the renovated auditorium
and MC it.''

Rimat steps back to put some distance between them. ``How could you write that horrid line?''
Her hand shakes as she takes the folded leaflet from her bag and hands it to him. He ignores it, and the leaflet
flutters down and lands on the carpet between them. Rimat quotes from memory:
``{\thinspace}`Next to~a throwing hand,
I'm the grenade ---'{\ldots}How could you?''

Alir stutters, ``I{\ldots}I{\ldots}''

Rimat locks his right hand in hers, ``How could this hand write such words?''

``Let me tell you how it happened{\ldots}listen ---''

``What's there to listen to?'' she fiercely cuts in.

``I wrote this while I was watching a TV documentary about a group of evacuated Balads. A little Balad girl
was crying about her doll that she dropped. And she couldn't pick it up because her mother was carrying her in her
arms, running{\ldots}''

Rimat stops him short, ``A little girl's tears about her lost doll inspired you to write such a poem?~ And
then somebody reads your poem and it incites him to throw a grenade! To kill!''

Alir is beside himself, ``That wasn't the idea of that third last line. I'll explain it to you ---''

``There's nothing to explain!''

``But you must listen, you must! The first two lines describe my identification with any human predicament.
And the third line --- the last one --- expresses the idea that as a result, I, like it or not, become part of any evil
done. It's a shocking line. Yes. It's hell. As much as I'm part of anything that's good, I'm also part of anything
that's evil. Now do you understand? It's predestined. It's a curse.''

``You need to be a philosopher to understand all this. Whoever reads this poem is sure that you're inciting
people to throw~grenades! To kill!''

Alir's voice is stifled, ``No{\ldots}No{\ldots}''

``You only think about yourself. Only about what words mean to you. Have you forgotten what happened
because of words?''

A shiver runs through Alir's body. He knows what Rimat's talking about. ``Rimat, you must believe me. I
had nothing to do with~what happened to Saffia{\ldots}nothing ---''

``Yes you did! You didn't do anything to stop~Saffia from being carried away by such rhetorics. The words
that led him to that deadly course of action. You didn't write words against those words. And now you wrote a poem
ending with such a line. You're so self-centered. So
egotistical.{ }You don't think about what people might and can read
in your words!''

Turning away from Rimat Alir covers his face with his hands. In his mind he sees that little Balad girl crying about her
doll. He feels as if he's crying with her. ~He whispers, ``I'll change that line. At the inauguration
ceremony I'll say that I'm replacing those words with others.~ I'll say this in front of the whole
world.''

Rimat quietly lets herself out of the room.

Unaware of this Alir continues in a whisper, ``I promise.  I'll be true to my promise.''
Hearing no response he uncovers his face and looks around. The room is empty. Was Rimat here? He goes out to the
corridor. No one there. He returns to his room. What's that on the floor? That leaflet with the poem! Yes{\ldots}Rimat
was here. Here in his room! Indeed!


\chapter{}

Stretched out on the bed Aera lays her hands on her belly. ``This baby doesn't let me be!''
she moans.

``A healthy sign,'' Mother leaves whatever she's busy with at the stove, comes and bends over
her, beaming.

``I'm scared,'' Aera clings to Mother{.}

Mother says, ``I was also scared the{ }first time.''

``I don't believe you,'' Aera presses her lips{ }to Mother's~dry skin,
breathes in its musky aroma. ``You only want to make me feel strong. You don't know what fear
is.'' She leans her head against her mother's breast. ``I want to be back inside you. To be
and not to be.''

``My silly little goat,'' Mother plants a kiss on her daughter's forehead.
``There's already someone who needs you. And I'll be with you all the time. I won't leave you for a single
moment.''

``Mother dear, how is it going to happen?''

``Oh my precious, you're so forgetful. How many times have I already told you? When it's time things take
care of themselves.''

``But the pains,~dear Mother ---''

``Those~pains~bear fruit and then they're gone.''

``But, Mother, my one-and-only, what kind of a life will my baby have?''

``A life of milk and honey.'' Sweet words flow from Mother's lips but her heart is heavy. What
has happened to her Aera? She was always so sure of herself, always facing each new day chin up. Is it Yamik she's
worried about --- the father to be? She goes over to the cradle in the corner, picks it up and sets it down next to
Aera's bed. ``How clever of you to get this cradle at the flea market,'' she says.

``You can find there almost anything you want. Except for a priceless Mother like you.''

``Once the baby's in the cradle all your worries and fears will be over. And now I must prepare some food
for you and your baby, and for his grandma who's already crazy about him.''

``Mother, my beloved Mother ---'' Aera's  sobbing.

Mother feels she ought to stay with her daughter a little longer. ``I look at this cradle and say to myself
that it's not new but is{ }still in very good condition. You can tell that it belonged to fine people
who loved and cared for their baby who lay in it. It's a cradle that brings good fortune. And look at the
handles!'' Mother tugs at the handles. ``\textit{Are they sturdy}! You can see they're newer
than the cradle itself and were fixed in place by someone with good hands. Let me feel the mattress, see if it's
well-stuffed.''

``The main thing is the idea --- not the little details,'' Aera responds echoing Glin's words.

Mother lifts the mattress. A slip of paper detaches itself from its underside and{ }flutters down to the
floor.

``What's that?'' Aera is alarmed.

``A bit of nothing-'' Mother picks up from the floor~an old yellowed photo of a man who looks dead. She
conceals{ }it between the palms of her hands.

Aera sits up, ``\textit{What is it}?''

``Nothing, just an old snapshot.''

``But if somebody's looking for it?''

``Who?''

``Whoever brought the cradle to the flea market. Give it to me ---''

``It's not good for you to look at it ---''

``Mother, \textit{let me have it!}'' Aera insists. Mother is forced to give in. Aera flattens
the photo and scrutinizes the man's face. ``This man looks as if he's just woken up. When he's washed his
face and has combed his hair he'll look most handsome. I'll go to the flea market and return this photo to that
stall.'' She puts the photo under her pillow. Later on she'll find somewhere to hide it. Doesn't the man
there look a bit like Glin? One day she'll ask Glin about this photo.  Let that day come soon!

``Don't put it there,'' Mother begs. ``It could bring bad luck.''

``On the contrary,'' Aera retorts, ``the cradle obviously belonged to fine people
as you just said. It'll bring me their good luck.'' She turns to the wall and asks, ``Mother
darling, tell me again, why did our people leave Pale Blue Valley?''

``I've told you so many times and I'll tell you again. We didn't choose to leave. We were forced to
leave. They were after us. Chasing us away.''

``Why?''

``They wanted our Pale Blue Valley for themselves. ~And they were strong and we were weak. We thought that
after  a while things would change and we'd go back. But it didn't happen. Now Yamik and the men will make it
possible for us to go back. Pale Blue Valley is so beautiful. It is there that once a year{\ldots}''

 ``Pale blue flowers bloom very early in the morning for one hour only,'' Aera chimes in, ``only once a
year{\ldots}'' She takes a deep breath and says, ``You know what, Mother darling? Let's make
a flower bed in front of this shack. Let's find some seeds of pale blue flowers to grow there.''

``A wonderful idea,'' Mother says, ``but it won't be instead of our real Pale
Blue Valley.''

``Of course not,'' Aera agrees.

 Aera seems to be feeling better now, more relaxed. Hopefully she's even fallen into a wholesome sleep. Mother goes back
to her chores at the kitchen alcove. Suddenly Aera asks, ``Mother dearest, will you ever stop wearing
black?''

``It's my{ }own skin,'' Mother says without a moment's reflection.

``Your embroidery's coming along nicely,'' Dela nods towards Rimat's busy hands

Rimat sighs, ``I've yet to see the end of it.''

``What made you pick~such a large a piece of cloth?  Big enough for what, actually?''

``It picked \textit{me} up,'' Rimat retorts. ``There it was collecting dust on a
shelf in the general store in that village. Nobody wanted it, so I took it. With no special purpose in my empty
head,'' she giggles.

Dela joins her. They giggle together like two young girls. A thought goes through Dela's mind ---  Rimat and Glin have
brought the girls{'} laughter back to me. Especially Glin.

``Did you ever go in for embroidery?'' Rimat asks. It hadn't taken her long to realize that
Dela was not devastated by questions about the past. On the contrary --- they seem to energize her.

``No, I didn't. I was never any good at handwork. Nor headwork, for that matter. I was
useless.''

Rimat knows~there's no point arguing with Dela's self-dismissal. Dela has already shared with her the `facts of life' of
this household ---  that had Zakod not finally~decided that the time had come for him to marry and start a family, and
had she not been the only~available woman in sight, she would have remained single and continued working as a technical
secretary at the university's History Department until retirement.

``Our girls were gifted,'' Dela adds. ``Moiku loved to embroider. Blaya loved
doing ceramics. Tiqvi would run to the neighbors to play their piano. Zakod had already put down a deposit for a piano
for her.''  Her emaciated arms --- resembling lifeless wooden sticks --- rub against the wheelchair's
arm-rests.

Rimat stands up and goes over to the cooker to stir the porridge. She tastes it, adds a pinch of salt and some sugar,
gives it another stir and tastes it again. She turns off the flame, fills a bowl with the porridge, puts it in front of
Dela and carefully fits a tablespoon into her hand at the right angle. ``Bon app\'etit ---''


Dela thanks her and tastes the porridge with the tip of her tongue. ``The very same taste that I used to
make for the girls,'' she smiles at Rimat and then says, ``Zakod explained to me why those
Balads did it. They had a reason and a purpose. He said this is how it has always been in history.''

``That senseless stupid history that keeps repeating itself,'' Rimat mutters.

Dela helps herself to a few more spoonfuls of porridge and then says thoughtfully, ``I saw the girls fall.
And then there were flames all around. I was choking. I passed out.'' She finishes the porridge.

Rimat asks, ``Would you like some more?''

``That's~how I used to ask the girls. `Would you like some more?' Thank you, Rimat, but I've had my
fill.''

Rimat sprays the window with cleaning fluid. Wiping the windowpane clear, something{ }in the distance
draws her attention. For a reason she doesn't understand she blurs the windowpane with another spray of cleaning fluid.


``You're working too hard,'' Dela says with feeling. ``That window was already
sparkling clean.''

``Not quite,'' Rimat says. She rubs the window clear again and looks out.

``Enough, enough,'' says Dela. ``You haven't had your coffee yet.
And{ }I want to drink mine with you.''

``In a minute ---'' Rimat lowers the venetian blind leaving the slats horizontal and then goes
to heat the coffee pot.

``How is it outside?'' Dela asks.

``Looks like spring,'' she says airily, gripping the cups, saucers and teaspoons tightly to
allay a wave of unease.

Dela asks, ``Do you remember what I wanted us to do come spring?''

``Of course I do,'' Rimat responds.

``I know you've already written it down,'' Dela says, ``but please~make a note again of the ages and the
colors. ~I want to say them again.'' Rimat picks up her pad and pencil and waits. Dela dictates,
``Moiku would be eighteen on her next birthday and the color she loved most was blue. Blaya would be
sixteen on her next birthday and the color she loved most was red. Aand Tiqvi would be fourteen on her next birthday
and what she loved most were polka dots.'' Her voice thickens, struggling with the tears.
``The color didn't matter to her. Why is it that of all things, it's my memory that
survived?'' Rimat dries her tears for her. ``Zakod doesn't let me say things like that. And I
--- if I don't say them --- how shall I remember, how shall I believe that I was once a healthy woman? That I was once a
mother. That I had three daughters. That I cooked and cleaned and washed clothes. And ironed them. And put them
away.''

``Go on talking, speaking, telling,'' Rimat encourages Dela and wipes away the crumbs around
her mouth. She then collects the dirty dishes and washes them in the sink.

``I can already imagine you going into town and buying the material,'' Dela says closing her
eyes as if in reverie, ``blue, red and any color at all but with polka dots. And your finding a
seamstress, asking her to make the dresses, specifying the ages. And when they're ready, bringing them home to show me.
Afterwards we'll think about where to donate them. We'll do this every year, right?''

``Every year, every year,'' Rimat responds enthusiastically. She knows there's no point
asking~Dela whether Zakod has hired a new laborer. She's come to understand that from the very beginning of their life
together Zakod has never shared with his wife his interests, activities and decisions{. }She certainly
won't{ }ask Zakod herself. Maybe it was a passer-by who chanced upon Glin in the distant field and
stopped there to exchange a word or two, and they decided to sit under the{ }leafy old fig tree.~ She
returns to the window and widens the gap between two slats of the venetian blind. ~The scene that worried her has
disappeared.

``I too enjoy looking at the row of cypresses back there,'' says Dela,
``especially early in the morning when it's still misty. I make myself imagine the girls there. How they
would have loved to play hide and seek between the trees there, maybe climb up that old fig tree in the
middle.''

Rimat comes over to Dela from behind and places her hands on her shoulders.

``Was Glin's father sick for a long time before he died?'' Dela asks.

``He was never sick. Heart failure is sudden.''

``How old was Glin when it happened?''

``Barely a month old.''

``What was his name?''

``Saffia,'' the name lingers on Rimat's lips.

``I know that that's your family name,'' Dela says ever so softly. ``What was his
first name?''

``It was his first name too,'' Rimat hears herself say with some kind of relief she cannot
account for. ``His first and last names were the same. His friends would sometimes call him `Double
Saffia' for fun.''  Had she not feared drowning Dela in her own pain she would have clasped her
shriveled hands.

Dela asks, ``Do you have a picture of him?''

``I had an album-full,'' Rimat says. ``Saffia's younger brother~was very good
with his box~camera. It was a hobby with him.  The number of pictures he took of us! But the album got lost when I left
our place and went to that village up north. Like many other things. I had only one snapshot left, also taken by his
brother, a picture that I purposely left out of the album. It didn't do his handsome face justice. It was taken just as
he woke up from a nap. I didn't want Glin to see it, didn't want him to think his father looked like that --- face
puffy, hair disheveled, eyes unfocused. So I hid it under the mattress of Glin's old cradle which I turned into a
sewing basket when he outgrew it. I kept it there and looked at it only when Glin wasn't there. And what happened? When
we were getting ready to come here and were already overloaded with luggage plus the violin and all kinds of stuff,
there was no way we could take the cradle with us, so Glin put it outside with the things we'd decided to discard. Then
I suddenly remembered the photo! I waited for an opportunity to go and rescue it when he wasn't around. But when I
eventually did, the cradle was gone. Someone must've~fancied it.''

``Oh my!''  Dela says broken-hearted.

``Who knows whether whoever took this old cradle-cum-sewing basket was curious enough to look under its
mattress.''

Dela waits a moment before asking, ``Were you and Saffia also lovers{\ldots}?''

``Yes{\ldots}We were.''

``I sometimes watch movies on TV. Men and women embracing, kissing. All those movies that Zakod thinks are
worthless.''

Rimat returns to her chair hoping to add a flower or two to the garland.

``What I really and truly had were the babies, the girls, the mature women they were going to become. I so
long for the body of a baby, a small child to hold close, very close to my own body. And then watch it grow, come into
its own, have its own likes and dislikes. Moiku was once very cross with me and she said, `Moumli' --- that's what
they used to call me --- `Moumli, don't call us all together `the girls'. Each one of us is different.'   And Blaya
once said, `Look, Moumli, there are so many whites in the room --- the walls, the moon in that painting over there, the
writing paper in the notebook --- and each white is different.' And Tiqvi once said, `Moumli, in music we can say how
much we love and how happy or sad we are a lot better than in words.' They opened things for me. They made me
understand things, made me see, hear. As if it was \textit{they} \textit{who gave birth to} \textit{me}.\textit{ They
who were bringing me up.}''

Rimat is almost moved to tears by Dela's gift with simple words.

``I so enjoy watching Glin looking out of my bedroom window,'' Dela carries on,
``I sometimes see him standing on the patio outside his room downstairs. His eyes are shut and he waves
his hands~as if he's conducting an orchestra.''

``He knows the pieces of music that he loves by heart. Every note. Every bar.''

``He told me that he inherited his love of music from his father.''

``His father taught himself to play the violin. Without a teacher. Just by ear. He always sang as he
worked. He was a house painter.''

``A few days ago I saw Glin talking to his Walkman ---'' Dela recollects.

``It was a dream.'' Rimat is happy for~Dela at having had such a pleasant dream.

``No, I really did,'' Dela insists. ``It wasn't a dream.''

Rimat~is intrigued, ``How did he talk to the Walkman?''

``Like this ---'' Dela lowers her mouth above her skeletal hands.

Rimat is frightened by Dela's graphic demonstration. It immediately revives the scene she'd observed a few moments ago
in the distant field --- Glin and an anonymous broad-shouldered man sitting together in the shade of the old fig tree
having a friendly chat.

``Rimat,'' Dela's emaciated arms again rub against the wheelchair's armrests,
``wouldn't you like to have another baby? You're still young. How I wish there was a baby in this
house!''

\chapter{}

``Shouba! Shouba!''

Is Alir in trouble again?~ Shouba rushes from the kitchen sink to the front door wiping his hands on his apron. He opens
the door and Alir practically throws himself inside. Fingers still damp, Shouba picks up his friend's beret that fell
off in transit.

``I've just filled twenty bottles with cleansing fluid for felt. You spray a little on, wait fifteen
minutes, remove the foam and --- abracadabra! If the spot doesn't disappear, you do it again. You repeat it as many times
as necessary.'' His jovial patter fizzles out as he absorbs Alir's frozen state of body and mind.
``What happened?'' He removes Alir's coat for him and drops it on a rickety
chair.  ``Alir, tell me what happened?''

``Were you there? After the tragedy?'' Alir covers his face with his hands.
``When Rimat screamed `murderers'! Her braids loose{\ldots}Dress hardly buttoned{\ldots}Screaming{\ldots}
Nonstop ---''

``Yes,'' Shouba whispers. What could have resurrected that horrific scene in his friend's
mind?  {}``Yes, I was there.''

Alir~shakes his head, ``I don't remember seeing you there.{ }I was so horrified by Rimat's
screams that I{\ldots}I simply{\ldots}ran away. Only after Rimat had left with the baby to go to that village up north
did I return to pick up my notebook and a few odds and ends I'd left behind.''

Shouba waits for Alir to carry on, but he doesn't. So he gently asks, ``But what happened
today?''

``She suddenly appeared{\ldots}An hour ago ---''

``Who?''

``Rimat ---''

``Rimat? She came to your place?''

``No. To my room in the TV building. When she'd gone I thought that it must have been a ghost. Because she
often appears in my dreams at night. In daydreams too. But it wasn't a dream. It was real. She left
this.'' He checks his pockets till he finds the crumpled flyer.

Shouba takes it from him. Hundreds like it are stored in his cabinet in the corridor ready for the next protest rally.

``She's angry about the last line,'' Alir goes on to explains. ``She accuses me
of inciting~bloodshed. I told her what inspired this poem{\ldots}What was on my mind at that time ---''

``I remember,'' says Shouba pointing at the TV set. ``We watched that documentary
together. You wrote the poem as we were watching it.'' How well he remembers watching that scene together
on the old TV set together with Alir ---  a group of Balad villagers being chased out of their homes. The camera
zoomed in on a mother with a little girl in her arms. The child held a doll and suddenly the doll slipped out of her
hands. The little girl burst into tears. The mother, in a panic to get to the truck waiting on the roadside to take
them away, was unaware of the reason her little girl was crying. She was facing forward~while the little girl was
looking back~at the doll now being~trampled~by the Balads{'} feet behind them.

``She said~it was these kind of words that led to what happened{\ldots}'' Alir mutters.

``To Saffia?''

Alir nods. ``I wanted to tell her that the Balads turned my poem into a political pamphlet without asking
me{\ldots}But I didn't get that far.''

``Why?''

``She disappeared ---''

``What do you mean `disappeared'?''

``She was suddenly gone{\ldots} Vanished into thin air ---''

Shouba feels for his sensitive friend. Poor Alir! If only he could protect him from Rimat's fury! ``So many
years have passed between~Saffia's tragedy and this poem ---'' he says shaking his head.

``The time lapse between the two events has nothing to do with it. It's the essence that counts. It's how
we feel about things. Rimat is right. People could take the last line as a kind of incitement{\ldots}For doing terrible
things~---''

Shouba doesn't feel qualified to enter into a discussion about poetry and its{ }ramifications.  ``Look,
Alir,'' he tries to explain, ``Rimat blames each and every one of us for what happened to
Saffia. She screamed at me then, `What kind of rotten bomb-timers did you concoct?' And I know --- I'm sure! --- that they
were perfect. Saffia and I tested them countless times, went through the whole process again and again. ~She also
screamed at Michlor ---''

``Who's Michlor?''

``Don't you remember Michlor Nissen? Who went to medical school?''

``I'd forgotten him ---''

``She screamed at him~for studying for his anatomy exam instead of rushing to give Saffia first aid. What
she screamed at Boni I don't remember. But scream she did{\ldots}I'll make some tea,'' he says without
budging, Rimat's screams resounding in his ears.

Alir paces up and down between the battered pots and pans and chipped china. ``When I lived in the
Saffias{'} glass veranda together with Boni, I couldn't help hearing bits of what you were all talking~about.~ But
it was so remote from me. I only wanted to love Rimat --- the woman that she was. And to love Saffia --- the kind, humane
person he was. And bask in the knowledge that she was nice to me and that he treated me like a real friend. And to
write poems.'' Absentmindedly he picks up a battered chess box from the floor and places it between the
legs of an upturned chair. ``I remember an argument~one evening between Saffia and Zakod in the other
room. I was sitting on my bed in that glass veranda. A poem started to take shape inside me about the bed
opposite mine.~ Boni's perfectly made bed. So indescribably tidy. About a bed never slept in. A life never been
lived. But my pencil merely doodled on the page because of the raging row on the other side of the wall. Saffia was
boiling --- unlike him at all.  He let fly at Zakod, `Go teach your pure uncontaminated history! In your ivory tower!
While we get~into the mud and blood of real, actual, history!' and Zakod hurled back at him, `You are too drunk with
it! You are not rational anymore!{}' And he walked out in a fury slamming the door behind him.''

``That was the last time Zakod was there,'' Shouba nods.

``I didn't notice.''

``Saffia told me.''

Alir sinks inadvertently into a heap of tattered~clothes and continues, ``After Zakod left, Rimat came out
to the veranda. Without knocking. I didn't want her to see my scribbles. They embarrassed me. So I pulled out that
page, crushed it and threw it sideways on the floor.
But she said `No~---', and she bent down, and picked it up, and
flattened it out, and handed it back to me.'' He skips over the rest of the memory: Rimat's body so close
to his own. Her big belly with a baby inside rubbing against him. She lays her hands tenderly on his head as though
comforting a small child.  This is a moment all his own --- a moment to die for. Out loud he says, ``She
pleaded with me in a whisper, `Go speak to Saffia, tell him to stop.' I said, `Me, of all people!?' And she said,
`Yes. Yes. You of all people. Because of all the people around him it's only you he'll listen to. Because you're not
\textit{in it}.' I didn't say a word to Saffia, of course. That \textit{too} she holds against me. From those
times.''

``Don't blame yourself. There's no reason to. None whatsoever.~ How does she look?''

``As beautiful as ever. Even more, because of some changes.''

``What kind?''

Alir closes his eyes. ``A touch of grey at the temples. A couple of creases between the
eyes.''

``They were always there ---''

``I don't remember ---''

``They appeared when she got angry. And that was not infrequent.''

``Her special kind of beauty{\ldots}The depth of her special kind of beauty~---''

They're silent.

After a while Shouba asks, ``And what about herself? What did she say about herself?''

``I told you. She just disappeared.''

``You spoke only about the poem?''

``I don't remember anything else. I wasn't myself. I was
overcome{\ldots}\linebreak[0]\hbox{Overwhelmed~---''}

``After the tragedy she moved with the baby to that village up north,'' Shouba recollects.
``She broke off all past ties. Did you ask her about the baby? I mean the boy? He must be grown up now ---''

``We spoke only about the poem. As I told you.''

``He must be around seventeen now{\ldots}Eighteen{\ldots}Nineteen{\ldots}How many years is it? I've lost
count{\ldots} Who knows what he inherited from Rimat{\ldots}What from Saffia{\ldots}If anything ---''

``Saffia Saffia will forever remain young,'' Alir muses. ``We'll get older and
older in the natural course of time. You'll invent another paste, another cleanser. I'll write another poem, rhymed,
free verse, metered, unmetered. And then{\ldots}Curtain. End.''

Shouba goes to the kitchen to put the kettle on. On returning to the front room he brings over a shabby cardboard box
and puts it on a heap of tattered blankets. ``Just look at this!'' he exclaims.

Alir immediately recognizes those thin paper sleeves of records inside the box. He's as moved at the sight of them as
Shouba. ``How Saffia saved up for those records! The almost holy reverence he felt for each one of
them!''

``The upstairs neighbor got in touch with me after Rimat had gone and told me she'd left a few things
behind --- in case I was interested. So I went over there. There was nothing really of value, but I just couldn't leave
Saffia's records there. I took them home, put them away and all but forgot about them. And the other day I came across
them when I was looking for something else.''

Shouba and Alir carefully lift out the records, read their covers one by one and replace them back in the cardboard
box.

Shouba says, ``I wonder if she also blames Zakod ---''

``His tragedy!'' Alir gasps. ``D'you know anything at all about
him?''

``Only that he resigned from the university. Seems that he didn't want
anything to do anymore with academic life. He
bought a farm somewhere west of town where he works and takes care of his wife. She's partially paralyzed as a result
of the explosion. Did you follow the case in court?''

``What case?''

``Against the Balads they arrested?''

``I couldn't take it. It would've finished me.''

``Zakod hired the best lawyer for their defense. He financed it.''

``Unbelievable ---'' Alir says and a chain of words forms within him about a disaster that
befalls a close friend, a catastrophe no one can avert.

``In a `Letter To The Editor' in the newspaper he explained the reason: so they`d be given their day
in court. A fair trial and not a public lynch. I understood his line of thinking. Still, it was weird. Rather going to
the other extreme, don't you think?{  }In the end they were acquitted because
of `a shadow of a doubt'. Everybody knew they'd done it.''

There's a knock at the door. Shouba opens it. The skinny young Balad standing in the doorway is familiar to him from
previous visits. ``Hello there, young man, come in,'' He greets the young visitor with a
warm smile. ``Good to see you ---''

``I came to leave a letter,'' Glin says, ``and perhaps there's one waiting for
me?''

Shouba opens a drawer in the cabinet. ``You're already familiar with the ins and outs of this post
office,'' he gestures amiably to~the~drawer.

``I appreciate it,'' Glin thanks him. Yes, indeed, there's a letter from Aera!
He leaves his letter in exchange for her.
On his way out he notices the shabby cardboard box perched precariously on a heap of
tattered blankets. ``May I take a look?''

``By all means,'' Shouba is delighted. ``It's just that they're covered with dust
---''

``They're old,'' Glin says as he carefully picks them up one by one and reads the labels.
``Rare performances. A treasure. Thank you. Good bye.'' He leaves.

``I never ask for their names,'' Shouba tells Alir, ``or where they live or what they do. Poking into their
private lives seems patronizing to me. I only want to help them. ~And now it occurs to me that I should have told that
Balad he could borrow any records he's interested in for some time.  You could see he's a music-lover.''

``No way,'' Alir objects. ``Those records are too precious.''

``You're right,'' Shouba agrees with him and carries on, ``Whenever one of them
shows up I think, what would Saffia have advised them to do? Keep on demanding their Pale Blue Valley back? Accept
their eviction from there? By the way, did you notice that young Balad's speech? No trace of an accent! He could
easily pass for one of us! Oh dear! What's that smell? Oh!'' He rushes to the kitchen. ``The
kettle's almost burnt out!'' he cries out from there. The kettle sizzles as he refills it.
``This time I'll stand watch here till it boils.''

Alir joins him in the kitchen and asks, ``And where's Golden-Hands-Gidal these days?''

``Probably in that village up north.'' By the time the water has boiled Shouba has washed the
dishes. ``He'd distanced himself from Saffia even before Zakod did,'' he
recollects. ``He was so frightened by Saffia's plans and fled up north. Thanks to that Rimat had whom to
turn~to with the baby.'' He makes room on the crowded slab for two cups. From the larder he produces some
aged biscuits. ``The bunch that we were ---'' He checks the teapot inside ---  yesterday's
tea-leaves still look promising. ~He scalds them with the boiling water.

Alir, watching him, says, ``I'll read the poem at the ceremony.''

``What for?'' Shouba frowns.

``So that I can change the last third line. Rimat is right. That last line could indeed be interpreted~as
incitement to bloodshed. I promised her I'd correct it.''

``Send her the corrected line by mail. She's probably still in that village up north.''

``I promised her I'd correct it publicly during the ceremony. In front of everyone.''

``You're asking for trouble, '' Shouba is serious.

The tea has brewed. He fills two cups.

``I want to be good to my promise,'' Alir declares.

Shouba realizes this is not the moment to make Alir change his mind. He will try and prevail on him some other day.
There's still time.

``I'll try and~get you a complimentary ticket to the inauguration,'' Alir says.
``The tea is excellent!''



\chapter{}

``Come in, Alir, come in ---'' Bonimi recognizes the timid knock at the~door. He stands up to
welcome the overgrown boy who enters his room hesitantly as usual. Despite their shared living quarters way back in
the past --- feet-to-feet in the glass veranda~at Saffia and Rimat's --- he never really got to
know him. At the time he was only aware of Rimat being nice to him, and mainly of his older brother's deep affection
for him. Lately he has come to feel his own growing warmth towards the disarming poet.

``What's the good word?'' He lays a hand on Alir's shoulder, directs him to the settee in the
corner and sits down next to him. ``Any problem? There's always one problem or another. Par for the
course.''

Alir takes a deep breath. ``At one point during the ceremony I too would like to read something
aloud.''

``By all means,'' Bonimi responds, adding jovially,
``why discriminate\linebreak[4] against the MC?''

``I mean \textit{that} poem ---''

Bonimi, immediately catching on, asks cautiously, ``Do you think it's appropriate?''

``I'd like to change the third line,'' Alir explains and then declaims: ``{\thinspace}`Next
to a human being, I'm a human being / Next to a Balad, I'm a Balad / \textit{Next to a throwing hand, I'm the
grenade}'.'' After another deep breath he goes on to explain: ``That third line is
misleading. What I meant to say was that if I identify myself with any `human condition' --- as I describe in the first
and second lines --- the conclusion is that when somebody throws a grenade, I share in this low, despicable, act.''

``That's what I understood myself,'' Bonimi responds spontaneously.
\linebreak[4]
``When the
Balads appropriated your poem, I felt that they'd misunderstood it. I thought that since they're so focused on their
own agenda, they see everything through that prism alone to the exclusion of anything else.''

``The problem is that they're not the only ones in the wrong. Some of us are also in the wrong. Some of us
also think that I preach, that I incite, that I encourage{\ldots}killing ---''

``Narrow-minded people were, are, and always will be around ---''
says Bonimi, and though
realizing he's failing to prevail upon Alir to change his mind, asks, ``Why bring this up again? It's all
in the past. You can rely on people's short memory.''

``Not all of them. Some people have a~long memory. Certain rumblings have reached me. This is why I want to
find a spot during the ceremony to explain myself, to say that I'm erasing~this line and replacing it with
another.''

Belaboring the ins and outs of the unfortunate poem ---  and this at the actual ceremony to boot --- seems to Bonimi an
untenable if not altogether an off the mark idea. That's on the one hand. On the other hand, he wouldn't want Alir to
feel that he's making light of his distress. ``There's another reason not to make this correction
publicly,'' he says. ``People will conclude that you got orders from above. And that'll put things in the wrong
light. And even if Public Television Network issues an official statement clarifying its position on the matter, it
won't help. On the contrary. It'll only strengthen that opinion.''

``But I must{\ldots}'' Alir stammers.

Bonimi tries another tack, ``Think about yourself --- if I may be so bold --- what kind of impression does a
poet who corrects himself make? What about the moment of inspiration? Can a later stroke of inspiration replace the
original?''

This argument makes sense to Alir. He lets it ride for a moment but then confesses, ``You see, I promised
someone I'd make this correction, this change~---''

``Somebody in the political scene? In the media?''

``Rimat ---''

``Which Rimat?''

Alir lowers his eyes. ``Ours ---''

Bonimi is thunderstruck. ``When? Where?''

``She came by. To my room here. A few days ago. I came in and there she was.''

Bonimi gasps. So it was indeed~Rimat in the lobby in that guided tour! It wasn't an apparition! He almost whispers,
``Just like that?''

``She came to speak to me about the third line. She said these kinds of words were the cause of Saffia's
tragedy. That he was carried away by this~kind of{ }rhetorics. She was wild{\ldots}And I promised her
I'd change it. In public. It haunts me.''

``What else did she say?''

``I don't remember. I was{\ldots}I wasn't myself. I was overwhelmed. I only remember what she said about
the poem{\ldots}Then she just{\ldots}Disappeared ---''

``Disappeared?''

``Just as she'd appeared. Suddenly.'' Alir's gaze is lost in space. ``The
nicknames you and Saffia called each other --- `Big-Saff' and `L'il-Saff'! How alike the two of you were. And how
different!''

``Saffia had his own original mind, his own original soul,'' Bonimi fears he may be losing his
grip. The scar begins to itch. ``I'm only a technician. I only file things away in their
compartments.''

``We called you Boni for short,'' Alir says. ``You didn't like it. You wanted to
be called by your full name --- Bonimi.''

``You're absolved for old time's sake,'' Bonimi smiles warmly.

Suddenly they find themselves together in the past.

``I once had a poem in mind and wanted to write it down,'' Alir recalls, ``and
there was no room on the table for the piece of paper I held in my hand. ~I looked for something stiff to put it on and
picked up a novel that Rimat was reading at the time. And she got really mad, `Don't take away my love story!'
\textit{But you are my love story, Rimat, }I wanted to say, \textit{You are the one who's taking away my love
story{\ldots}} I don't remember if you were there ---''

``Indeed I was,'' Bonimi says. ``I remember that. Yes. You were all in love with
her.''

``You too?'' Alir asks.

``Young as I was ---'' Boni nods in assent.

They fall silent together.

Alir is the first to break it: ``And the poem? What shall we do about it?''

``Whatever you decide.''


\chapter{}

Through the closed door of the upstairs landing Glin hears his mother speaking with Dela in the kitchen.  She's
folding the laundry and Dela's explaining where things go. That should take a while. As for Zakod --- since he's just
shut himself in the store-room, he can be trusted not to emerge outside for at least another half hour. In other words,
now is the time to practice the technique of communicating with Yamik. He puts on the earphones and speaks into the
mike plugged into his Walkman, ``Yamik, can you hear me?'' He lengthens the antenna.
``Yamik, can you hear me \textit{now}?'' He changes the angle of the antenna.

The door above opens and mom is coming downstairs. He disconnects the mike and collapses{ }the antenna.
Eyes closed, Walkman on his chest, he stretches out on his bed.

Rimat, now in her room, opens the wardrobe, takes out one of her dresses and drapes it over her arm. She then crosses
her room and stands at Glin's open door. As always she's moved by the sublime expression on her son's face when he's
listening to music --- something between concentration and elation. She turns back to her room.

Glin mumbles, ``What-where-when-why?''

``Nothing to do with what-where-when-why,'' Rimat responds almost in a whisper.

``But{\ldots}?'' he raises his voice, demanding.

``I don't want to disturb you.''

``You already have. You've already spoiled everything, ruined everything.'' He waits a second
for her reaction --- to no avail. ``Please mom, I beg of you, what's   the problem?  And~don't beat
about the bush!''

``Okay, straight to the point,'' Rimat returns to his room. ``A few days ago I
thought I saw you with someone under that old fig tree far away in the field ---''

``This `I thought' of yours is what's called `beating about the bush'. Since when has your vision been
impaired? You saw~right. But why did you wait until now?''

``I don't know ---''

``Your admittance of ignorance is indeed praiseworthy. It was some guy who lost his way.''

``Where did he want to go?''

``To the lake. I told him they're spraying~pesticides there so he'd better make a detour.''

``It took you long enough to explain this ---''

``He got interested in my Walkman. We started talking --- about music, recordings, standards, and what not.
Come. Sit.'' Rimat complies and sits on the edge of his bed.~ ``What's eating you
up?''

``The two of you spoke so earnestly ---''

``I was trying~out being earnest. A new experience for me.''

``Serious conversations scare me.''

``Why?''

``Because they do.''

``It was only a show. Don't you worry your pretty little  head.''

``Seems I'll always worry. Pretty little head or not.''

``A waste of emotional resources.'' Glin remains apprehensive. Hasn't he seen with his own
eyes~the pile of clean laundry upstairs waiting to be folded and sorted out? So why did his mom rush down now instead
of taking care of it? To spy on him? ``What's with Dela?''

``She's busy with some patterns for those dresses she wants to make for her three poor
girls.''

``Shrouds ---'' Glin shudders.

``Afterwards she'll donate the dresses to some worthy cause. Doing this is a kind of{\ldots}I don't know
what to call it. Anyhow, I told her we could duplicate a pattern from one of my dresses and she wanted to have a look at
it. That's why I came down now. To get the dress. ~And --- lucky me --- get on your nerves while I'm at it.''

``Think nothing of it, mom.''

Rimat wonders~whether she should bring up the real reason for coming to his room --- ~ Dela's description of his speaking
into the Walkman. She decides against it. ``What are you listening to?''

``A trio by an anonymous composer.'' How fortunate, he thinks, that mom is not into music and
won't ask to hear whatever he's  not listening to.

``Happy listening,'' Rimat waves her old dress in the air, turns round, crosses her room and
goes upstairs to the main floor.

Glin waits until the door above closes and then~makes another attempt to get through to Yamik. ``Yamik, do
you hear me?''

Yamik's desperate voice comes through the earphone, ``Glin, I'm not~getting the hang of it{\ldots}Glin, I'm
not ---''

The connection is cut off. He and Yamik must meet again. Yamik needs another practice session.



\chapter{}

``Home, sir?'' asks the~chauffeur.

``Home indeed,'' the CEO answers. The darkness inside{ }the limo's back seat,
the routine question and answer between him and the chauffeur, the even hum of the motor --- all these give Bonimi a
sense of peace he yearns for during the hectic hours in the TV building and the{ }bleak solitude when
at home. He knows that once the limo merges with the traffic~the chauffeur will comment on something in the news, the
results of the last poll, whatever.  The words will filter into his ears as if through a thick blanket. He pats his
scar lightly.

``Today's the last time, sir, that we're taking this route home,'' the chauffeur says as he
maneuvers the roundabout.

``Why's that?''

``On the dot at midnight our good old Old Road becomes pedestrian.''

``I all but forgot about that,'' says Bonimi who reacts impassively to external changes.
``So this is our swan-ride. You cannot stop the wheels of progress, can you ---''

``This morning they cordoned off the place where you, sir --- when you had some spare time --- would get out of
the car and take a short walk. They're going to put up a municipal information center there. `MIC' for
short.''

``About time, isn't it ---'' Bonimi says in good humor while he's tormented by the knowledge that he won't
be able to take his walks there anymore. { }

``Especially its being so close to the Citadel. It's always so crowded with sightseers and tourists around
there. They've put on~an exhibit there of old weaponry. I went to see it with some relatives here on a visit. They were
most impressed. And so was I.''

The chauffeur's words drone on in Bonimi's ears till they turn into a mixture of disconnected syllables. Rimat's sudden
shriek cuts through:  `Boni! Saffia's gone out! Did you give him the pump? \textit{Did you}?' He's abruptly torn
from deep sleep and immediately knows where Saffia is heading. Hadn't he heard snatches of what went on between him
and his buddies? He grabs the pump from under the bed and rushes out. It's still dark. One street before the Citadel he
literally bumps into~Saffia ---  the bike's rear light is of course off. `What are you doing here, L'il-Saff?' his
brother whispers. He whispers back, `I brought you the pump, Big-Saff.' And Saffia whispers, `Thanks a lot, L'il-Saff.
And now back to beddy-bye!'  He realizes that Saffia is pushing the bike rather than riding it because it's weighted
down. `I'm staying here with you, Big-Saff,' he says, and Saffia says, `No way. L'il-Saff~still needs his sleep. He's
a growing boy.'  `No. Big-Saff needs L'il-Saff's help,' he says. He grabs~the~bike's handlebars. Saffia pushes him
aside. He tries again but Saffia whams him out of the way. Saffia has never hit him like that. He falls face down on
something sharp. His left cheek{ }is bleeding. An excruciating pain paralyzes him for a moment. `So
very-very sorry, L'il-Saff,' Saffia apologizes as he sprints off~with the loaded bike towards the Citadel. He tells
himself it's going to be all right. Weren't those bomb-timers made by his brother's close friend Shouba? But in a few a
minutes there's an explosion. And then another one and another one. Why so soon? A huge flame shoots into the air,
smoke all around. There's nothing he can do about the pain in his left cheek. He gets up and runs, runs, runs. Suddenly
his foot hits the bike thrown down on the road. He runs some more. And there lies Saffia. He bends over him, whispers
to him. But Saffia doesn't respond. Somewhere inside he knows that Saffia is dead. With a huge effort he manages to
roll the body into a ditch. His blood and his brother's mingle{. }He covers the dead body with stones
and rubble. Why? He covers it with earth. Why? Because he's afraid. ~Afraid of what will be said about Saffia, about
what he did. Afraid of what'll happen to \textit{him} because of it. He runs back home. Some of Saffia's buddies are
already there. Rimat's standing in the middle of the room half-dressed, hair flying, hysterical, the baby in her arms.
`Murderers!{}' she's screaming, `Every one of~you!'  Seeing him she yells, `You're another one! You're no
longer Glin's uncle!'

The chauffeur decelerates, ``Here, sir ---'' he points.

``What{\ldots}? What's here?'' Bonimi asks.

``This is where they're putting up The Municipal Information Center. MIC for short.''

``I see.'' He looks out. The new structure is covered with scaffolding and nettings.
It{ }clearly promises to be an impressive building. Again he's assuaged by pain. Once they start
working on that building he'll no longer be able to take his walks in the area.

They drive on in silence until the chauffeur exclaims, ``What a long line in front of the
Citadel!''

Bonimi turns to look.

``What a crowd!'' the chauffeur is excited. ``Even small kids in carriages and
strollers. Wow! And how many tourists!''

``Yes indeed,'' Bonimi agrees.

The chauffeur slows down because of a traffic jam. ``The other day they said in the papers that the
Citadel has been rated a top tourist attraction,'' he says.

Bonimi surveys the line of people waiting at the gate, winding round the building. Once they're in, he knows, they'll be
guided, shown, enlightened. They will be told about the series of explosions towards the end of the so-called Phony
Occupation that wrecked an entire wing of the Citadel, about the mass grave of unidentified dead, about parts of their
bodies found scattered all around, in the open, under rubble, some hit directly. some killed by the blast.

Among them Saffia Saffia. Among them his Big-Saff

``By tomorrow this street will become pedestrian,'' the chauffeur announces almost formally.
``Tomorrow we inaugurate the Ring Road.''


\chapter{}

``I think you've got the hang of it now,'' Glin says.

``Yeah, I think so,'' Yamik grins. He turns off his Walkman and puts it in his basket.

Glin leaves his on. ``All the same, how about another try-out,'' he taps his Walkman, ``just
to be on the safe side?''

``No need.'' Not that Yamik is super-confident, but he now feels quite capable of handling
this apparatus. He winds the earphones{'} lead into a neat spool and tucks it next to his Walkman. ``Exactly
every hour on the hour, right?''

``Right,'' Glin says, ``but what if one or both our watches go a bit slow or
fast?''

``We should sync them twice a day with the radio signal,'' Yamik suggests.

``Perfect,'' Glin agrees.

They stand up and brush the sand off their clothes.

``How did you get to be such an expert on this?''  Yamik is curious to know.

``A response to an emotional need, I guess,'' Glin answers. ``Because of being
crazy about music for as long as I can remember. And since my mother's allergic to music, I had to find a substitute for
the radio and gramophone. And then some genius invented earphones! From there I went into sound engineering while I was
still at school and the rest --- as they say --- is history. Yamik,'' Glin is serious now, ``this
may be the last time we meet under this fig tree ---''

``Very likely,'' Yamik agrees. Every time they've met here under the old fig tree he's
imagined himself soaring high up in the sky~and looking down on the leafy canopy concealing the two of them. He
reflects on~the stroke of fate that brought them together.  Aera looms in front of him radiant in~the full bloom of
her pregnancy. He turns to Glin who's busy with his earphones, ``Have you prepared the
ground?''

``I kind of mentioned something at the gas station --- just by the way,'' Glin replies.
``Same with some of the neighbors.''

``And the old man, your boss?''

``What he had to say! Don't ask!'' Glin goes on to imitate Zakod's furious voice,
``Joining that shameful army! Becoming a soldier of evil!''

``Perfect,'' Yamik is satisfied.

Glin shakes his head, ``It's so hard to get into a heated argument \textit{artificially}.''

``There's no other way, buddy{\ldots}So ---'' Yamik is quiet for a second and then continues,
``barring anything unforeseen, next time we see each other is when I get to your place to do the
swap.''

``Any guess when?'' Glin asks.

``I'll only know by the end of this week through my boss through his son who is a recruiting officer. My
boss is a good guy and a blabber-mouth of the first order. Through him I'll learn about the date of the next
recruitment. And there's another piece of luck: the Cessation of Work Order in the Eastern Hill Project has
been~extended for half a year, so you won't be disturbed there.''

The two of them are quiet for a moment

``Things are falling into their places so neatly,'' Glin is excited, ``like in a
jigsaw puzzle.''

Yamik nods. Maybe too neatly, he's thinking. In the face of his companion's enthusiasm he keeps the thought to himself.

{}``This'll knock them flat, won't it? When we pull it off!'' Glin is ecstatic.

``That's the whole point,'' Yamik shelves his worries for the moment. ``To take
full advantage of the time and place!''

``I have every confidence in our success!'' Glin announces.

Yamik nods in assent. ``By the way,'' he asks, ``Can you drive?''

``I can and I even have a driving license,'' Glin responds, ``why do you
ask?''

``Who knows --- but it could come in handy. And while we're at it --- do you have a letter for me? It'd spare you a
trip into town to the Center.''

Even though Aera and he only write each other about trifles --- entrusting their love to what's in between the lines ---
Glin is irritated by Yamik's allusion to their correspondence. Still, Yamik's practicality must of course take
precedence.  He takes the envelope out of his pocket and hands it to Yamik.

``Did you write her about the explosives?''

``But of course!''

``I'm sorry, but that's not good.''

``Why?'' Glin feels reproached and disappointed. True, he did want to show off a bit. But the
main idea was to please Aera and prove his commitment to the Balad ideal of the return to Pale Blue Valley.

``The thought that someone might actually get hurt bothers her,'' Yamik explains.

``What's there to worry about? I described it all to her in my letter, that the way it's planned,
they   wouldn't want to suffer any damage, any injuries, any casualties.'' As he's talking Glin
wonders, am I no longer \textit{one of them}? He has never given this a
thought. Who are those with whom he's `\textit{We}{}'? Who are those who are `\textit{They}'? Being bonded with Aera
body and soul has nothing to do with it. It's only since he got to know Yamik and what ensued from that
bond that these questions sometimes surface to trouble him. To prevent his being sucked into an abyss, he
would then hang on to Aera, to music, to the Balad ideal of the return to Pale Blue Valley.

``Of course they wouldn't want any damage, any injuries or casualties,'' Yamik says.
``This is what the whole plan is based on. Absolutely. But Aera refuses to understand that if we want to
be taken seriously, that \textit{unless we actually plant the explosives in place}, it
will make our threat empty.''

``I explained all this to her in those very words,'' Glin pleads.

``She won't understand because she doesn't want to understand. She's stubborn,'' Yamik insists, ``I know
her. You may write her about anything you like except for our plan and the explosives.''

Frustrated as he is by this veto Glin naturally accepts Yamik's authority. He tears up the letter and puts the scraps in
his pocket.

When all of this is behind us, Yamik reflects with~longing, I'll tell Aera how I got hold of the explosives, how I hid
them, how I knew where to plant them around the TV building.

He brings a bag of cookies out of his basket. ``Help yourself,'' he offers them to Glin,
``it's from Aera ---''

Glin takes one and remarks ``I didn't know she baked ---''

``O-ho!'' Yamik exclaims. ``There's nothing my cousin can't do. And with flying
colors! So what shall I tell her?''

``My thanks, with a mouthful of her cookies,'' Glin bursts out
laughing and is tempted to ask
Yamik how is it that beautiful Area is still unattached. He immediately checks himself.



\chapter{}

Yamik covers the last stretch home at a sprint. He bounds into the shack.

``Aera! Auntie!'' He hugs his aunt, kisses Aera and peers into the cradle,
``Ah{\ldots}still empty!''

``A~man who is about to become a father for the first time has no patience,'' Auntie humors
him.

``Gifts!'' announces Yamik. He hands Auntie the first parcel he takes out of his rucksack and
then lays the second one in the cradle. ``I already want to spoil our baby{\ldots}'' he smiles indulgently.
``And last but not least,'' he turns to Aera, ``for you ---''

``It's so stuffy in here,'' Aera gets up before he manages to take her gift out of his
rucksack and goes outside. Her heart is heavier than ever.

With the merest nod of her head Auntie conveys to Yamik that Aera's
mood swings can be attributed to her condition.

His rucksack in one hand Yamik follows Aera outside. With his other hand he strokes her shoulder and feels it stiffen.
As they reach the tree he gently turns her around to face him: ``Let me look at you ---''

But all she can manage is a curt rebuff:   ``I don't want you giving me the letters in front of
Mother.''

``Has that ever happened?'' he asks, offended, and immediately apologizes,
``Sorry, Aera, but what I brought you is a real gift ---''

``I'm sorry too,'' she says humbly stricken by her conscience. What right does she have to
torment this pure-hearted brave man whose life is in constant danger? ``I don't know what's happening to
me ---''

``Never mind, love,'' Yamik is all too ready to absolve her. ``And here it
is!'' The parcel he takes from his rucksack is wrapped festively and tied with a colored ribbon. He says,
``I don't have a letter this time. I didn't have a spare minute to call in at the Center.''

Aera's fingers tighten around the parcel he's given her. What do his words actually mean? Does he want to conceal from
her the fact that Glin hasn't written? And in that case --- why? Or has he begun to sense there's something between Glin
and herself and that's why he didn't call in at the Center?

``Anyhow, that skin-and-bones who can't live an hour without his Walkman and earphones writes the same
thing in every letter,'' Yamik smiles at her, ``but the main thing is that he
 keeps  writing ---''

``Nothing we can do about it, is there?'' Aera says, her heart at rest.

``But the way he talks sometimes{\ldots}'' Yamik adds, ``like a standup comedian
---''

Aera feigns surprise, ``As I recall he's as dry as a bone.''

``I guess he's more relaxed with me ---''

``Seems so.''

 Whenever Yamik reports to her about having met Glin she must be on her guard not to let slip a tell-tale word. How well
she remembers what Yamik said after first meeting Glin on~the street opposite the Center, `His eyes scanned me from top
to bottom as if searching for you, as if I'm hiding you somewhere --- ' She almost broke down then. Summoning all her
strength she barely managed to utter a dull `Ah ---'

Mother comes to the window to invite the young couple to the table. Looking outside she{ }takes in the
easy flow of conversation between the two of them. Let them be. Her heart at ease she returns to the cooker.

``What's the good word?'' Yamik pats Aera's belly.

``Same,'' Aera smothers a desire to shake off the unwelcome hand.

``Kicking a lot?''

``It's such a lazy baby,'' Aera says and begs the baby to cooperate and stay still for the
duration of this moment.

``I love that baby with a kind of love I didn't know I had in me. He's our togetherness.''

Aera knows she ought to say something that would echo his feelings, but she can't. She touches the hand lying on her
belly intending to remove it but Yamik, interpreting this as a desire for closeness, presses his other hand on top of
hers.

Making a slight movement to free her belly from his touch she says:  ``A couple of the men came over the
other day. They complained that you're keeping yourself to yourself. Mother told them that it's not like you to do any
such thing.''

Yamik turns his gaze to the shack, ``Let's move a bit further away.'' They take a few steps
further from the shack. ``I'm taking note of your advice,'' he speaks slowly, measuring each
word.

Aera asks herself what kind of advice she's given Yamik. Then she remembers. ``Does that mean they
suspect that you may be planning something on your own?'' she asks.

Yamik nods.  ``What is it?'' she takes his hand.

``Something.'' Yamik makes do with a single word.

``Yamik, tell me. I can keep a secret. Is it to do with the TV building?''

Yamik nods.

``What?''

``I'll tell you another time.''

``Yamik, what?'' Aera insists.

``I'll tell you when it's finalized.''

Aera stretches up as high as she can and folds her arms round Yamik's robust neck, her face against his unshaven cheek,
her belly rubbing against his hard torso. ``What?''

``After the renovation there's going to be a big to do there. It'll be broadcast over all radio and
television channels. Like you once said --- we need to tell them about Pale Blue Valley. They need to have things
explained to them, to as many people as possible.  So I asked my boss the contractor if he and I could swap places.
That way, he'd be on the Eastern Hills Project site and I'd be in charge of the TV building auditorium renovations. And
he agreed!  Meaning that now I can begin to plan something.''

``Like what?'' Aera is intrigued.

``To take over the broadcast ---''

``You'll need some help from \textit{their side }for that ---''

``And \textit{there is}.''

Aera tries to conceal her trepidations, ``You mean{\ldots}him?''

Yamik wonders what's that strange twitch in her right eye? Does that, too, have to do with her special `condition'? He
says, ``The very same.''

Aera feels that the momentary flutter of her eyelid has gone, that she's regained her composure. ``I don't
think he's capable of anything like that,'' she dismisses Yamik's choice of Glin out of hand.

``You're wrong,'' Yamik contradicts her. ``You don't really know him. You don't
know about all the things he's capable of. Not to mention his expertise in sound engineering, transmission, and all
that.''

``That expertise of his is one thing,'' Aera tries to sound objective, ``his not
being a serious person is another.  He doesn't know how to take on~responsibility. All he cares about is his music.
And you yourself say he's a clown. If~something funny crossed his mind he wouldn't keep it to himself. He'd blather,
ruin everything.''

``No, no,'' Yamik is adamant. ``Underneath all that he's serious, he's
responsible. And he wants to help us. He's completely committed to our Pale Blue Valley. So it's very good and wise
that you've told him all about it.''

``He's like a little boy, impressionable, easily excited.'' Aera tries to sound flippant.
``He would be a hazard.''

``He's with us all the way,'' Yamik says, and hesitates a bit before going
on,{ }``for you, he tells me,~the sky's the limit. Pale Blue Valley is the limit.''

They hold each other's gaze for a moment.

Aera doesn't believe that this is what Glin actually said but prefers not to question it. She should be careful not to
focus the conversation on the relationship~between Glin and herself. She rubs her eye to prevent a further flutter.

``I probably know him better than you by now,'' explains Yamik. ``We've become
friends.''

Aera forces herself to shrug her shoulders as if saying `That's your affair', and asks~nonchalantly, ``Will
it be dangerous?''

``No,'' Yamik says, though he doesn't sound too convincing.

``And if they get wise{ }to it? Find out?''

``They won't.''

``How can you be so sure?''

``Because I am.''

``You've suddenly started believing in the supernatural?'' Aera giggles. ``In
luck? In fate?''

``The plan will be perfect.''

``Like the perfect crime?'' she stares at Yamik who nods in affirmation, ``You must tell me!''


``As I told you,'' he says. ``When it's finalized.~ To the last dot.''

``You're afraid I'll tell mother? There wouldn't be a squeak out of me. Come on, tell me just a tiny bit ---'' she screws up her face like a peeved child.

``You'll know in time.''

``Promise?''

``I promise. And don't mention it when you write to him. He must think that it's a secret between him and
me only. I'll go in to say goodbye to Auntie. I must get a move on.''

Aera stops him, ``Do you remember what we said about{\ldots}killing?''

``It won't happen.''

``You promised ---''

``I did,'' Yamik reaffirms and then adds, ``You haven't opened your gift~---''

``I'm saving it ---'' Aera hopes these words sound convincing to Yamik. She doesn't accompany
him back to the shack.

``I have to rush, Auntie,'' Yamik tells his mother-in-law.

``Won't you have a bite first?'' she points to the table set for three.

``Sorry, but I must get back ---''

Auntie hands him a food package. ``Here are some of your favorite morsels,'' she says
lovingly. ``And I've told the men who came by how well you know that acting alone is another word for
stupidity and short-sightedness.''

``Loads of thanks, auntie.'' They exchange kisses.

He goes out{ }to Aera for their farewell. ``Don't forget to eat and drink for our
baby!'' he tells her. Then his voice becomes serious, ``Aera ---?''

``What is it?'' Aera is all ears.

``I don't know when I'll manage to get here again. You understand why. The men will be our go-between.
We'll communicate by a code of our own. That's how you'll let me know about the big event.''

Aera yields to his arms and lips. They end by shaking hands silently. ~He turns to leave. She doesn't take her eyes off
him. Every few vigorous steps he turns round and waves goodbye. Eventually his image blurs as he disappears in the
darkness of the night.

``What did Yamik bring you for a gift?'' Mother asks her as she enters the shack.

Aera unties the colored ribbon and undoes the festive wrapping to reveal a silver-plated set of brush and comb.

``Beautiful,'' mother is enthralled. ``Yamik is crazy about your hair. My gift is
a packet of knitting yarn --- the right gift for a grandmother. And what did he bring our baby?'' She opens
the parcel lying in the cradle. ``Look!'' Mother exclaims at the sight of the folded fabric
she took out of the parcel. ``He knew that I wanted to make a new cover for the cradle's mattress and he
found a piece of cloth printed with pale blue flowers!''

Aera stretches lazily on her bed and asks~absently, ``Is there enough material?''

Mother holds the fabric at the corners so that it unfolds to its full size. ``More than
enough,'' she's delighted. ``Enough for a bed sheet \textit{and }a quilt cover.  For
both.'' Her laughter ripples through the house. ``Our baby will lie in a field of pale blue
flowers!''

Aera says, ``It's a long time since you laughed like that ---''

Mother returns the piece of cloth to the cradle and embraces Aera. ~``I'm drunk~with happiness because of
the baby! And you, my child, why have you stopped laughing?''

``I'm tired,'' Aera sighs, ``tired all the time ---''

``You're eating for two, my little one, drinking for two, and also tired for two. Just rest yourself, my
treasure ---''

Mother gets up from Aera's bed and once again spreads out the piece of cloth. ``The flowers are almost the
same color as those in our Pale Blue Valley. That once a year{\ldots}''

``Pale blue flowers bloom{\ldots}'' Aera joins in in a cadence of legendary litany,
``very early in the morning, for one hour only, for one week only, once a year ---''

``You remember the old tale{\ldots}'' Mother whispers. ``Just close your eyes, my
precious,~and go to sleep ---''

Peace descends on the shack.

Suddenly it is shattered by Aera's cry, ``Mother!''

Mother is quick to rush to Aera, holds her trembling body. ``What is it, my little one?''

``Mother, Mother, Mother ---'' Aera mumbles, ``I'm afraid, Mother, I'm so scared
---''

``Is Yamik planning something dangerous? All by himself?''

Aera huddles in her mother's arms. ``If the baby is fatherless ---''

``Why such bleak thoughts? Our baby will grow up with a mother and a father the way it should
be!''

\chapter{}

Zakod almost pounces on Glin as he enters the store room. ``What kept you so long?'' he
demands of him.

``One of the sprinklers got jammed and I{\ldots}'' Glin starts to explain.

``Well, that is a relief. I worried for nothing. You look tired out.''

Glin pours himself a glass of lemonade from Zakod's thermos. He{ }slakes his
thirst in one gulp. Refreshed, he perches on the edge of the desk, feet dangling.

{}``If that is the case,'' Zakod continues, ``maybe there are other sprinklers that need replacing.''

``Stands to reason,'' Glin nods, thinking it might well be an idea to check all the sprinklers
before leaving. ``But what got you so worried?'' he asks all innocence.

``That you might have gone ahead with your plans.''

``Oh, that ---'' Glin laughs the idea off. ``Don't worry. Not yet, as you
see.''

``Anyway, it is kind of you to at least spare your mother from knowing what is on your mind. As for me, I
have not yet lost hope of convincing you to get back on the one and only right track.''

``Don't bother ---'' Glin, pours himself another glass of lemonade.

Zakod feels like pacing up and down the way~he used to during his lectures in the past when he needed to get his
thoughts into focus. But he remains seated. Still, he cannot throw off his old didactic authoritative tone of voice.
``The Ascendency Of Man Over Beast,'' he declares, ``with capital letters. True we are
ninety-nine percent made up of chemical processes and impulses, but one percent is rational thinking. And that one
percent is what enables us to make rational choices.''

``Isn't that a chemical process too?'' Glin
asks, feigning earnestness.

``It is, but of a different nature.''

``We've often talked about it and thought it over.  Zakod, you did your best.''

``No, I did \textit{not},'' Zakod insists. ``I still have to try and prevail upon
you to change your faulty mind-set. Okay. Let us not rehash the moral principle that it is your privilege to choose
\textit{not} to refrain from risking your life when others risk theirs. But do you know what the army is busy with
nowadays? Would \textit{you} be able to push Balads around? Drive them~from place to place? Evict them? Frighten them?
Beat them? Threaten them with live ammunition? And if something gets out of hand? And that live ammunition comes to
life? And it hurts and~injures and kills?''

Glin cries out within, if you only knew the truth! Out loud he says, ``I'm such a diehard nonentity, so
superficial! I love{\ldots}music. But that too is superficial. Because I love it for pleasure, not for studying~it. Not
for adding to it by composing something new. I'm not a deep person, I'm tissue paper thin. And now I must go, I
promised mom to take in the laundry before it gets dark.''

As he's almost at the door Zakod speaks: ``I once had that kind of disagreement with a very dear friend.
The situation was different. The considerations were different. But the principle was the same. I carried on until I
stopped. I simply{ }grew tired.''

``And what happened then?'' Glin asks.

Heavy gloom descends on Zakod.  Saffia's image looms before his eyes. His voice grows hoarse. ``It ended
in a tragedy.''

Glin scrutinizes Zakod's face that looks lost in thought. ``Why
should{ }I have to pay for a precedent?'' he asks almost in a
whisper.



\chapter{}

Aera opens the door and shades her eyes against the sun. Whose footsteps are these?

``Oh! If it's not our good friend Gidal!'' She welcomes him happily. ``What a
lovely surprise!'' She steps down and goes over to the
cradle~under{ }the tree.

``Good day,'' Gidal responds as he gets nearer, ``I haven't congratulated you yet
---''

``You haven't been up here yet,'' Aera retorts emphatically, her face radiant. She lifts the
mosquito net. ``And here is{\ldots}nature's wonder!''

Gidal bends over the cradle. A perfect small round head covered with shiny hair and adorned with a tiny rosebud ear lies
in a field of pale blue flowers. The thought about this baby's conception in the darkness of the cave makes him
uneasy. Ever since the first time he observed Aera and Glin~stealing inside it he always stood by at a safe distance,
like a guard protecting their trysts. ``A beautiful baby ---''

``A little bitty chick,'' Aera feasts her eyes on Baby and then lets the mosquito net fall
back.

With a gallant gesture Gidal presents her with the jar of honey he's brought along, ``To sweeten your good
fortune.''

``Thank you so much,'' Aera examines the jar. ``It's from the village beehives,
right? Thanks from Mother too. She's gone shopping.'' Aware of the special relationship between her mother
and Gidal she adds, ``She'll soon be back.''

Having familiarized himself with the daily and weekly routine of the
\linebreak[4]
woman-in-black, as he thinks of her, Gidal, for
some unknown reason to himself, timed his visit today to find Aera alone.

 ``I don't know anything about babies,'' he says. ``I don't know what kind of
gift to buy for a baby.''

``You brought him the best gift of all. He shares with me whatever I eat and drink. You're so good. You
made it possible{ }for us to work in the village. You arranged for us~to live
in this~shack after renovating it yourself. And now you've brought us this sweet honey.''

``Your Mother told me that you'd given birth to a baby
boy.'' At the time he'd been struck by the woman's unbound joy at sharing the good news with him --- as
though not troubled by the infant's unknown paternity. ``What's his
name?''

``He doesn't have one yet. He's waiting for his father to come home so we can find a name for him together.
Meanwhile we call him Baby.''

Gidal is flabbergasted. Does she mean to spell out the identity of the father as Glin? To relieve himself from the
tension he says, ``Baby is smiling in his sleep.''

``Baby's dreaming sweet dreams. Please sit down,'' Aera motions to the bench
outside. ``It's so comfortable. Wasn't it made by your own
golden hands? I'll treat you to a cup of tea plus something else to go with it.'' She hurries inside.

Gidal calls after her, ``Please don't bother!''

``I'll join you,'' Aera calls back. ``I need to drink too --- Baby's orders. We'll
have a tea-party!'' She soon emerges, carrying a tray with two cups of tea and a plateful of cookies.
``We'll sweeten the tea with your honey,'' she
places the tray on a small stool. They enjoy the aromatic brew and the home-made cookies together. ``Isn't
this great?'' Aera says brightly.

Gidal nods in agreement.

Aera is wondering --- this man who was born so good-hearted, was he also born to be alone?

Baby whimpers. Aera takes him out of his cradle, seats herself on the doorstep, covers herself
discreetly with a corner of the bed sheet of pale blue flowers and begins to
nurse him.

Gidal, watching, is awash with emotions{ }he's only once before experienced --- when Rimat nursed baby
Glin that day when they had first arrived. He's timed his visit well to be alone with mother and Baby. He returns his
empty cup to the tray and goes over to the cradle. ``A nice old cradle,'' he
observes{.}

``I picked it up at the flea market for next to nothing,'' Aera tells
him{.}

How could that be, Gidal wonders. The history of the cradle is indelibly inscribed in his memory. A short time before
Rimat was going to give birth, Saffia had come by it in lieu of reimbursement for a plastering
job{ }he'd done. Rimat had cleaned it inside out~and fashioned a mattress for
it from an old pillow. And then Glin was born and was put into this cradle. And a short time later he'd replaced
the cradle's frayed handles with new ones. How well he remembers Rimat and Saffia's appreciation. No less unforgettable
was how Alir --- the Saffias{'} homeless poet friend who shared the glass veranda with Saffia's young brother Boni ---
would swing the cradle back and forth with Glin inside, sometimes swing it almost full circle to Rimat's shrieks of
horror. And then{\ldots}a few days after{\ldots}Saffia's tragedy{\ldots}Moshko the village guard~had come to tell him
there was a woman with a baby at the gate asking for him. And the woman was Rimat~holding this cradle with Glin inside
in one hand, her other hand gripping a suitcase and two bags, Saffia's violin case slung on her shoulder. And in time
Glin outgrew the cradle and Rimat turned it into a sewing basket which he saw whenever he came by to visit. And not
long ago Rimat told him the cradle would be one of the things she and Glin wouldn't be taking along with them when
they'd leave the village to move to Zakod's --- being encumbered with so
much luggage as they were. So how did the cradle find its way to the flea market for Aera to come by it?

``What would you say if I got hold of four wheels on a metal frame and fixed the cradle inside it? And then
it would also become a baby carriage?''   he suggests.

``I'd thank you more than you could ever imagine ---''

Baby is sated. Aera hoists him onto her shoulder and he responds with a loud burp. She breaks into a laugh that turns
into a cry.

``Oh ---'' Gidal is beside himself ``I'll be off ---''

Aera collects herself, dries her eyes. ``So nice of you to have come,'' she smiles at him.
``And again many thanks for the honey. From Mother too.'' Aera watches him as he begins the
descent downhill.  His back has started to bend. She calls after him, ``Come again, and often. Baby would
like to see more of you!''


\chapter{}

``Next to a throwing hand --- let my arm wither.'' Does it sound right? Alir tears up the~piece of paper he'd
jotted these words on{ }and tosses the scraps behind him. Another failed
attempt.  A poem about his present predicament begins to congeal inside him as the scraps of paper pile up like a mound
of snow. But he resists the temptation and once again confronts the challenge. He writes down, ``Next to a
throwing hand --- who am I?'' This scrap of paper immediately joins the heap. The same with
``Next to a throwing hand --- my hand isn't mine.'' He then
simply{ }writes, ``Next to a throwing hand ---'' He
contemplates these words. Can that remain as is? Leave the dash?  Replace it with three dots? With a question mark?
An exclamation mark? Add both? No good.

He gets up and wades through the mound of snow. ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' he hears his own
voice, ``dear friends, honored guests,~listeners and viewers, please bear with me. A while ago I wrote a
poem entitled `Next To'. It had~three lines, `Next to a human being, I'm a
human being~/ Next to a Balad, I'm a Balad~/ Next to a throwing hand, I'm the grenade ---' A most bitter
condemnation was hurled at me at that  third line. I was told it could be taken to mean that I condone violence, that
my intention is to incite it. No. A thousand times~NO.  Nothing could be further~from the truth. Nothing negates my
fundamental, spiritual and ethical credo \textit{more}. I've tried to correct this line, believe me. Again and again.
And I have not found the right words. Please let me explain myself. ``Next to a throwing hand, I'm the
grenade ---'' When a despicable, base, vile, criminal individual throws a grenade, I too become base,
despicable{ }and vile. I too become a criminal. Rimat, do you hear me? Do you
understand me?''



\chapter{}

``Glin ---?'' Rimat murmurs.

Even though he'd opened the door soundlessly and crossed her room barefoot on tiptoe, she'd woken up.
``Shhhh{\ldots}'' he whispers.

``What's this shhhh about?'' she asks.

He answers, ``Not to wake you up ---''

But Rimat is already sitting up in bed, ``Please, Glin, can we do without the gags? For once? I was worried
stiff about you ---''

``Why?''

``Didn't you hear?''

``No.''

``A bus was ambushed. Two killed, fifteen injured --- three seriously.'' Since he was a teenager
she's stuck to her resolution never{ }to ask about his
free-time diversions, but tonight she can't help it.
``\textit{Where were you}?''

``I went to a movie. A stupid comedy but OK in parts.''

``And only \textit{now} you got home?''

``I met a girl there, very funny girl. Went to a pub.'' Glin compliments himself on the
nonsense nonchalantly rolling off his tongue. He keeps it up, ``And you don't hear the news there. The
important thing is that I came home safe and sound, right?''

``Right. On the Balad side three were killed and a few injured. They didn't say how many. Terrible. It's
all so terrible. When will it end?''

``Let's not dwell on it, mom. Weren't you supposed to sleep upstairs to-night? With Dela?''

``Zakod didn't go to that colloquium.''

``Why?''

``The ambush made Breaking News on TV at seven and people were told not to take to the roads until~the all
clear.''

``It's almost two in the morning, mom, go to sleep.''

``I brought down a tray for you ---''

``Heartfelt thanks, mom, or should I say `bellyfelt' thanks?'' Glin responds, hopeful his
mother is satisfied. With a bit of luck she'll go back to sleep now.

``Glin, where are your CDs?''  she ventures.

``Since when have you become so nosey?''

``I did some cleaning ---''

``I discovered a music store in town where they exchange `oldies' for
\linebreak[4]
`newsies'.''

``So where are those `newsies{}'?'' Her agonizing worry again gets the upper hand.

``They're on order.''

``You never mentioned it.''

Glin is worried. Why has she suddenly become so inquisitive? So suspicious? But he keeps up the patter,
``Music didn't use to be one of your priorities. Now, I gather, it has ---'' Glin yawns
loudly{,} ``Nighty-night, mom~---''

``Ditto, son ---''

Glin waits. Mom stretches on her bed, turns over once, twice. Finally she breathes the even breaths of~sleep. He
tiptoes to the door between their rooms to check. Yes, she's fast asleep. After closing the door between their rooms
as~quietly as possible he takes off his thick overcoat and woolen sweater. Waiting for Yamik for so many hours outside
in the cold he thought he'd freeze despite their protection. He switches on the bedside lamp and then opens the window
and the shutter as quietly as possible. How fortunate that he'd
taken Yamik's wise advice to oil the hinges beforehand!

 ``Yamik ---'' he whispers.

Yamik materializes in the dark outside the window and asks, ``Where's your mother?''

``In the next room. Sound asleep.''

Muscular Yamik springs, cat-like, into the room.

``Welcome,'' Glin points to his bed.

``And you?'' asks Yamik.

Glin lays a straw mattress on the floor and sits down on it. ``Am I not allowed to be the hospitable host
in my own pad?''

Yamik takes off his muddy boots and sits on the edge of the bed.

``Feel better now?'' Glin asks him. Yamik shakes his
head.{ }``I thought you got used to it ---''

``There was a time in the past when I got used to it. But now it's like starting all over
again.''

Glin considers this for a moment. ``I thought that once you get used to it, that's it,'' he
says.

``I also used to think that way,'' says Yamik. ``Well it doesn't --- not with me anyway{\ldots}Damn this
operation that went wrong,'' he hisses, then adds after a brief pause, ``I wasn't too near
the shooting, but when it suddenly{ }broke out I
just{ }wanted to get the hell out of there. Except that once I saw what was
happening to my friends I couldn't \textit{not} shoot.''

Glin shuts his eyes. Multicolored spheres collide with each other under his eyelids. ``I'd do the same for
you,'' he says,

``Do you understand what that means?'' Yamik asks. ``What killing
means?''

``I don't want to understand,'' Glin says. ``I want to believe that if it's
necessary, then \textit{it is}.''

``You waited for me for hours, in the dark, in the cold,'' Yamik says. ``I'll
never forget that ---''

``Had I been a sweeter person I'd have frozen into a popsicle,'' Glin can't help saying.

``So sorry about it,'' Yamik says earnestly. ``For the life of me I'd no idea
it'd take me so long to get to you. First the operation that went wrong, then the damned road blocks you had to
bypass.''

``It's okay. I survived. You survived. We both did.''

After a moment Yamik asks, ``Did you write those letters?''

``Yes.''

``Dating them the way I told you?''

``Yes.''

``The first dated tomorrow and the rest one week apart?''

``Right.''

``May I see them?''

Glin retrieves a packet of letters from its hiding place in the cupboard and hands it to Yamik.

Yamik counts them. ``There are only four here.''

``I didn't finish the fifth. The one that's going to be the first for her to read.''

``Where will you leave it?''

``On her bed.''

They fall silent again.

Yamik stretches out on Glin's bed. ``Let's get a bit of shut-eye now. We need~all our wits about us when we
make the swap. ''

``How long can we sleep?'' Glin asks.

``A full hour. Do you have an alarm clock?''

``I'll set my mind to a piece of music~that lasts an hour.''

``You and your music ---''

They share a chuckle.

After a minute's silence Yamik says, ``This attack on the bus came just at the wrong time. Now they'll
probably double security.''

``But we'll carry out our operation all the same, won't we?'' Glin tries to encourage Yamik in
order to encourage himself. Yamik keeps quiet and Glin asks again, ``Won't we, Yamik?''
Yamik's silence continues. Glin doesn't break it.

Eventually Yamik says, ``I sometimes feel that I've already lived out my life.''

``You don't really mean that, do you ---''

Yamik doesn't reply.

Glin begs him, ``Yamik, say something ---''

``I must try and stop wanting \textit{to be}. Only then will I free myself of the fear of
death,'' he says.

What does he mean,  Glin wonders.  He doesn't ask him.

\chapter{}

It feels like there's somebody in the room. Rimat wants to open her eyes, but they're heavy-lidded. For a brief
second she does succeed and realizes that it's Zakod.

``Rimat, wake up,'' she hears his voice, ``\textit{Rimat, you must wake up.}{}''His soft voice
does not conceal its harsh core.

``I can't{\ldots}''  the two syllables mush together in her mouth. `Mom, I joined up. I had to. Forgive me if you
can. I'll keep in touch. Your Glin' --- these  words  keep  throbbing  in her ears.

{}``\textit{You must force yourself to wake up!}{}'' \textit{ } Zakod insists. He gently puts his arms around her
shoulders and pulls her like a rag doll into a sitting position. ``Here, I am putting a pillow between your back and
the wall. Lean on it. There you go.{}'' Once again she forces her eyes open. Her face suddenly feels cool.
It's   the damp sponge in Zakod's hands.

``Try to keep your eyes open,'' Zakod urges her, ``it seems that the sleeping pill I gave you was rather too strong
for you. I brought you some lemonade. Try and drink it.''

``I can't,'' she mumbles. ``There's a horrible taste in my mouth ---''

``It is the pill\textit{. Make yourself drink}.{}''

She takes a few sips. It's the lemonade she made for Dela.

``Here is a bit of hamburger I warmed up. Try and eat it.{}''

``No ---'' and the words `Mom, I had to' keep throbbing in her ears. Now she even hears them in Glin's own voice.

``The more you eat and drink, the sooner the effect of the pill will wear off.''

Rimat gives in, munching and swallowing mechanically.

``How do you feel now?'' Zakod asks.

``OK{\ldots}'' she mumbles. Now she can raise her eyelids a little. ``What's that light outside?''

``It is early evening,'' Zakod says.

``Such a strange light,'' she gazes at the window.

``Maybe because you are always upstairs at this time of~day.''

``What are you doing?''

``Checking your forehead.''

``Am I injured there?''

``Only a small cut. It was bleeding before. Now it has stopped.'' Once again he dabs her face with the wet sponge.

``That's pleasant,'' she says, ``I forgot that I fell ---''

``Eat some more.''

``Don't force me ---''

``Take one more sip at least --- please.''

``OK.''

``And do not fall asleep.''

``I'll try my best.'' Things start to get clearer. Glin's terrible letter. The fall. The pain. The scream. The
bleeding. ``Why did he decide \textit{now}?'' she asks, ``\textit{why suddenly now?}{}''

Zakod says, ``Why does the Vesuvius erupt at one specific moment in time and at no other?''

{}``You think this wasn't on impulse? That the idea of enlisting has been bubbling inside him for a long
time?''

``The need of an individual to belong to a large social group is basic. It is one of the items in the kit
called Equipment For Survival. EFS for short.''

``Please, Zakod,'' Rimat implores, ``please{\ldots}no lecture now ---'' She feels his hand enclosing hers. There has
never been such physical closeness between them. Now it's vital to her so that she can ask,
``What's going to happen to him now?''

Zakod is quick to respond: ``He has a very good chance of getting out of it unscathed, even though he has
left civilian statistics and entered military statistics.''

``Where's his letter?''

Zakod retrieves Glin's letter from the night table and hands it to Rimat. She can't get her eyes to focus on the
words.

 ``When will he get~some time off?''

Zakod ponders for a minute and says, ``That will depend on several factors which I am not familiar with.''

{}``What service will they put him in?{}''

{}``What he is most fit for --- in my opinion --- is Communications. Relatively speaking it is~less dangerous than other
services.''

{}``Communications?'' Now things begin to fall into place like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Glin's meeting with that
stranger under the old fig tree. The conversations he had via his Walkman. The disappearance of the discs. Of course!
He must have been recruited some time back and the army put him into some initial tests. And only now did it become
official. ``May I close my eyes for a bit?'' she asks.

{}``Only if you keep on talking.''

``How's Dela?''

{}``She is alright.''

{}``Did you give her her medicine?''

{}``Yes.''

{}``Did you give her{ }her lunch?''

{}``Yes.''

{}``And did \textit{you} eat?''

{}``I did. Do not worry. I told Dela what happened. She is also worried.~ She has become attached to both of you. She
loves both of you so very much. She loves to depend on you, Rimat.{}''

And I love to take care of her, Rimat thinks to herself. But everything has now lost its meaning because of what Glin
did. He betrayed her. And he removed himself from her physical protection.

When Zakod had rushed down at the sound of Rimat's cry and read the letter clasped in her hand
he{'}d immediately understood what had happened. Right there and then he had decided not to share with
Rimat his having been privy to Glin's conflict between remaining a~conscientious objector or enlisting in the
army. If he would share this knowledge with her, she would most assuredly pounce on him, saying that just as he had
sinfully refrained from stopping the father in the past to go ahead with those cursed bombs, so has he
sinfully refrained from stopping the son to go ahead with his calamitous decision  in the present.

Zakod and I refer to Glin in the third person, Rimat thinks to herself. We don't mention his name. It's
too intimate, too painful. `Mom, I joined up. I had to. Forgive me if you can. I'll keep in touch. Your
Glin.' These words will keep throbbing in her ears forever. Until she's done with this life.


\chapter{}

Coming home after seeing off the men who had dropped in, Mother finds Aera still stretched inert on the bed. She clears
the table. How ravenous they were! How thirsty! She was so happy to offer them food and drink. She must carry on with
life, go on working in the village for the sustenance of her daughter and Baby\textbf{ }and herself, and here at home
she must continue with housework.{ }But above all she'll continue to worry about Aera. Why has her
daughter become so distant? She never imagined this could happen. ~Their shared feelings and worries should have
strengthened the bond between them. What has come over the~only child --- one out of the five --- who survived? The perfect
daughter she has always been? What is it that's~gnawing at her heart? ~Aera shows no interest in the flower bed she has
planted outside the front door even though it was she who suggested it. ~She only smiles at Baby. It's him alone she
cares for, feels for, talks to, sings to.

Aera finally gets up and goes to have a look at Baby. He's sound asleep. She should help mother. She takes the broom and
sweeps out the dried mud left from the men's boots. She can't stop thinking about that old photo that was stuck
to{ }the underside of the cradle's mattress. She'd hidden it at the very back of her drawer. She
mustn't forget to take it out and show it to Glin. Let that day come sooner than soon.

Mother is cheered at her daughter's sudden display of activity. ``I walked with the men all the way to the
fork in the road,'' she says chattily. ``Again I reminded them that Yamik took part in the
ambush of the bus along with them.  Clear~proof that he isn't keeping himself apart.''

Aera is irked, ``Why do you meddle?''

``They feel that he's put distance between himself and them,'' Mother explains.
``That's the reason they came by.'' After a moment's silence she adds, ``As they
were leaving, the eldest of the bunch --- who seems quite sharp --- asked `What happened to Aera? Why does she keep so much
to herself? Why doesn't she say anything?' I told him that you're tired.''

``You said the right thing, Mother darling,'' Aera wishes to reassure her. The sweeping
accomplished, she goes back to bed.

Baby whimpers. Mother picks him up, ``He cries more when his pale blue flower quilt cover is in the wash
and he has to make do with a substitute,'' she says.

``That's wishful thinking, Mother love,'' Aera says, ``but be my
guest.''

Mother whispers to Baby while changing his diaper, ``You beautiful Baby, you and I know the truth. You'll
have your favorite quilt cover with the pale blue flowers dry and ironed by tomorrow.'' She brings Baby
to Aera. For a while the shack is filled with sounds of hearty sucking. When Baby has had his fill, Mother takes him
from Aera, burps him to her satisfaction and then lays him~back in the carriage. Wheeling him back and forth she hums
the Pale Blue Valley song. Baby falls asleep. She studies his peaceful features. ``I see your face in
his,{}'' she says, ``Yamik's too. Separate and mixed together.''

Aera says, ``I see many faces in his face ---''

Mother thinks, it's been so long since Aera expressed such pleasant words. ``That good
man from the village fixed an excellent metal frame with wheels for the cradle,'' she says,
``Baby has a real baby carriage now. `Golden-Hands-Gidal' they call him there --- and rightly
so.''

She puts on the kettle to make some tea for Aera. With her back to her she says, ``I didn't tell that
clever chap that you keep quiet altogether.'' She brings  to Aera a cup of tea with milk and a piece of
cake.

``Thank you, Mother dear,'' Aera says, ``but I'm not thirsty, I'm not
hungry.''

``It's not for you,'' Mother says, ``but for my grandson. Eat up and drink
up.''

Aera heeds Mother's bidding. Afterwards she again stretches herself on her bed and turns to the wall,
``Mother darling,'' she says, ``tell them at work that you need to have a day
off next week because you have to baby-sit for your grandson. I want to meet with Yamik in town. I'll fill~a bottle of
milk for one feeding. And there's~milk powder in the fridge for the next one if I return late.''

Mother is more than happy to comply. ``Excellent,'' she says, ``if the weather's nice, I'll stroll with him
outside in the fresh air. Now that you made this clever pouch to attach to the carriage, I can put his bottle inside
and he can have a picnic in the shade of a tree.''

``Make a sandwich for yourself too,'' Aera says cheerfully as she turns over to face her
mother, ``so that you can join him in the picnic.''

``It's so daughterly of you to think of me,'' Mother retorts in kind and adds,
``I'll send some goodies with you for Yamik.''

``That will be great,'' says Aera.

``Won't you tell me \textit{anything}?'' Mother implores her.

``Don't ask me, Mother darling, and I won't have to make up stories.'' Aera
turns back to the wall.

Mother says, ``But now \textit{I }will tell \textit{you} something that I never told anyone. Never talked
about it. It happened years ago when I was young, not yet married. We lived in a small village far away. It was after
they had expelled us from Pale Blue Valley. One day we saw a man on~horseback galloping towards us. ~When he came close
we realized he was an officer in \textit{their} \textit{army}. He said there was an order for us to move~elsewhere.
And then he galloped off. A huge commotion broke out. What should we take with us? What should we leave behind? I hid
my father's axe under~my coat, got on a horse, rode after that officer and called after him. He stopped. I got close to
him as though I wanted to offer him some food and drink. He leaned towards me and then --- with all my strength ---  I
struck him with the axe and he fell off his horse. Dead. On the way back I threw the axe into a deep gully. I didn't
utter a word about it. Not to anyone. That night they laid siege on  us with full force. They asked who killed the
officer. Everybody said it was \textit{not} one of us, but \textit{they} said it was. And they went through the village
killing and raping, and drove us out. And we wandered and wandered until we found a deserted place to settle in. I've
never told anyone what I did.''

After a long silence Aera's voice is heard, ``Would you do the same today?''

``No, of course not,'' says Mother. ``Today I would act more wisely. Today I
wouldn't act alone but join with others.''

``You knew very well what I planned to do to that guard in the village. Why didn't you tell me what you
yourself had done in the past?''

``It was my secret.''

``It may have encouraged me.''

``I didn't think you needed encouragement.''

``Not everybody is as brave and strong-willed as you.''

``Aera,'' Mother sits down next to her on her bed and pats her shoulder, ``Yamik
\textit{does} distance himself from the men. I feel it. What is he planning to do on his own?''

``An exchange of secrets{\ldots}?'' Aera hides her face in Mother's bosom and bursts out
crying. ``Mother darling, Shhhh ---''


\chapter{}

Janha,~pen and pad in hand, sits facing the CEO ready to take notes.

``I'd like to extend the meeting with the Selected Recruits by another half-hour,'' he says,
``one half-hour meeting is almost pointless.''

Ezlip, sitting next to the CEO, objects, ``You mean to spend another half-hour on that?''

It's obvious to Bonimi that his aide said `spend' instead of `waste'. ``I'd like to be more generous to
these wonderful guys,'' he explains to him with his natural smile and then returns to Janha,
``I know I can trust you to juggle the timetable.''

``Thank you, sir,'' says Janha, jotting down the CEO's request, ``and may I add ---''

``Don't bother with the `may I','' the CEO prompts her amicably, ``I'll take
it as an order ---''

``I heard that this tour provided for the Selected Recruits is going down very well with
them,'' the secretary says, ``and I also heard that there'll be a column about it in the
press accrediting you with the idea.''

``Nice to hear,'' Bonimi accepts this compliment with his usual equanimity.

When he initiated these tours for outstanding recruits in the TV building ending with their meeting with him, he
asked that each recruit have his name affixed to his lapel and that a list of their names be given to him in advance.
He did all that in the hope that this might  happen --- and{ }it did! The name
of `Saffia, Glin' shrieks at him from the list!

``I'll have to notify security about lengthening the meeting,'' Ezlip heaves a theatrical
sigh.

``I hope that this won't entail too much~trouble,'' says Bonimi pleasantly and then carries
on, ``and as for security, from the last briefing I conclude that the level of security has been
somewhat relaxed. They don't see a threat lurking behind each and every corner.'' He puts on an impromptu
mime of `searching' --- which elicits a short chuckle from Ezlip --- and then continues, ``Who knows
whether it isn't meant to boost a sense of confidence.''

``In whom?'' Ezlip asks.

``On our side, on theirs,'' the CEO shrugs his shoulders and smiles
at Janha, motioning to her that she's free to go.

This trait of the CEO --- his friendly and tactful behavior towards anyone he comes in contact with --- should also be
highlighted when he finally agrees to stand for~public office.  Ezlip commits this point to memory and then says,
``If I may be so bold, sir, I'd like to repeat my suggestion that you go into politics.''

``I admire your perseverance,'' Bonimi replies.

``First of all, you've become a public figure,'' Ezlip is all too happy to harp once more
on his favorite theme. ``And secondly, you have natural gifts and inclinations.''

``Like what, for example?''

``The ability to think and~decide.''

``I'm beginning to impress myself,'' Bonimi says, ``and am starting to
blush.''

``And, third,'' Ezlip continues, ``there's that heroic chapter in your
biography.''

``What are you talking about?'' Bonimi asks, welcoming the itch in the scar.

``Your brother died as a hero in the so-called Phony Occupation.''

``It's my brother. Not me.''

``But you can be identified with him.''

``No way.'' The scar continues to itch. How Bonimi loves it. He's tempted to touch it, but
naturally holds back.

What a shame the CEO didn't take his advice to have the scar on his left cheek
removed~by a plastic surgeon. That
thought repeats itself again in Ezlip's mind. Still, even with that scar, his picture in the media alongside mention of
his heroic brother will win him quite a few votes.



\chapter{}

``Rimat, there is a big surprise for us in the papers today!''

These kind of remarks made by Zakod sitting in his armchair in the living room to her in the kitchen always irritate
her. They break her stream of inner thoughts. { }How many times does
she have to explain{ }to him that the fact that she's busy with housework
doesn't mean her mind is free for all? But in vain.

``There is a write-up here about that big inauguration ceremony in honor of the renovated auditorium in the
TV building. And now I know why our poet Alir was appointed to MC it. Do you know who is Chief Executive Officer of
our Public Television Network? Bonimi Saffia! Our old Boni! Your brother-in-law! Never too late to be
updated.''

``Really,'' Rimat emits softly and continues scraping the carrots. She doesn't tell him that
Gidal had long ago shared with her that piece of information. Nor has she told him about her guided tour of the TV
building and its two outcomes --- having it out with Alir about that terrible poem he wrote and incidentally catching
sight of Boni. She's preferred to keep all that to herself.

``I am so sorry,'' Zakod apologizes. ``I forgot. I have invaded the sovereignty
of your inner thoughts. Still, I allow myself to continue. I guess I can put two and two together. Bonimi appointed
Alir to MC the inauguration ceremony for old time{'s} sake --- when the two of them shared the glass veranda at your
place. Am I right in feeling that there is no contact between you and Boni?''

``Enough said.''

Zakod goes back to his newspaper.

``I'm going to go to that event,'' she informs Zakod. She doesn't reveal her reason --- to
actually be in the audience and make sure with her own eyes and ears whether Alir keeps  the promise he made
her.{ }

Zakod is taken aback. ``I never would have guessed that you would go for such nonsense,'' he says.

``Would wonders ever cease ---'' she retorts.

``It will be transmitted on television,'' Zakod reasons.

``Depend on your set which glitches not infrequently?'' She readily responds.

``You win,'' Zakod raises his hands. ``I shall order a taxi to take you there and
back. And do not start protesting. You should not be alone on the roads at night. ~Especially so since this grand
splash might end in an ungodly hour --- if at all.'' Zakod now comes into the kitchen, newspaper in hand,
and sits down at the table. He continues to talk to Rimat's back while she now washes the carrots and cuts them into
rings. ``Saffia and Boni were so close.  How devoted they were to each other{.}  The
nicknames they used to call each other --- `Big-Saff' and `Li'l-Saff'. They were not at all alike --- neither physically,
nor mentally. But one trait they shared --- their genuine feelings for their
fellow men. Yes. I am quite sure that it was for old-times-sake that Boni asked Alir to MC~this hullabaloo. It is
also a brilliant idea. As far as I remember, Alir cannot but be authentic, disarming, spontaneous. He will charm and
impress them all. Did you happen to come across the poem he wrote about the Balads?''

Her first impulse is to deny it. But then a second impulse takes over. Zakod judges every issue according to its merit.
She would very much want to hear what he makes of the poem. ``Yes. I did. Did you?''

``I certainly did.''

``And what do you think of it?''

``A very powerful poem. Compressed in about twenty words, cadenced in three lines, Alir succeeded in
conveying a whole powerful idea.''

``This is what you say about a poem that encourages aggression? ~Incites killing?''

``If this is your question it means that you too, my dearest, have failed to understand the last line like
too many others. Including those unfortunate Balads.''

Rimat quotes from memory, ``{\thinspace}`Next to a throwing hand, I'm the grenade' --- how else can that be
understood?''

``The poem progresses from the general to the particular,'' Zakod explains in his pedantic
manner. ``The first line --- `Next to a human being, I'm a human being' --- is about the universal, the kind
of identification that any individual can feel with his fellow man on the simplest, most basic level. The second line
--- `Next to a Balad, I'm a Balad' --- here we are on the level of a specific human predicament that is so very well
known to us. But it has to be understood that the `Balad' in the context of the poem does not only represent a Balad
who lives among us, but also the Balad Experience, capitals B and E.''

{}``What does that mean?''

``It is about being a displaced, homeless individual, being at the mercy of others. And the third, final
line, `Next to a throwing hand, I'm the grenade' --- has to do with a basic ethical issue. That when something base,
despicable, horrible, happens in the world, like it or not, we all have a share in
it.''

Could that have been Alir's line of thinking?  Rimat wonders.  A line of thinking that I was blind and deaf to? And
when I came to have it out with him, he couldn't explain it to me because he felt like a frightened little schoolboy in
an oral exam? She turns to{ }Zakod, ``But most people understand
it quite differently.''

``The Minds of most people are~limited. It is a most unfortunate fact.''

``Writers and poets should write so that people can easily understand them,'' Rimat is
adamant.

``Rimat, you are totally wrong! Writers and poets should gear~their creativity to the deficient level of
comprehension of most people?''

Rimat comes to sit down at the table facing him. His explanation is beginning to grow on her. When the event is over she
must go up to Alir and admit to her misunderstanding and apologize for her preposterous demand of him. This strengthens
her wish to be there in person.

``It was most thoughtful of Glin to ask about Dela and{ }myself and convey to us his
warmest regards,'' Zakod says. ``Please convey to him our warmest regards.''

``I certainly will,'' Rimat responds. Since it's Zakod who brings in the mail from the mailbox
out there on the main road, he must have surely noticed   the two letters she's received from Glin during the last
few weeks. She so appreciated the fact that he didn't ask her about their contents. They were too intimate for her to
share. ``So good to know that Glin seems to take basic training in his stride,'' she says.

``So good indeed,'' Zakod agrees.

``And I so hope that eventually they'll put him in Communications.''

``Safe and sound there,'' Zakod is happy to chime in. ``And far-far from those
unsavory frictions with the Balads.'' The atmosphere between him and Rimat is now open. It's a propitious
moment to ask, ``Do you remember the morning of the explosions?''

Rimat forces herself to be calm. She says, ``I mainly remember my shrieking~that morning.''

``Do you remember that I had come over to your place a few hours~earlier?''

``Yes{\ldots}No{\ldots}It's all so hazy ---''

``It was still dark when I knocked on your front door. The way you looked when you opened it I realized
that I had woken you up. I apologized and said that I came to speak with Saffia. You said that he had already left. I
asked, `For work?' You said so very curtly, `Yes'.''

``I only wanted to get rid of you at that moment,'' Rimat immediately recollects.
``I was bursting with milk. Pure agony. After you left I picked Glin up, nursed{ }him and
then laid him next to me in bed. We dozed off together. And then it hit me --- why had Saffia left so early without
telling me? When it was still dark? Then it dawned{ }on me. I went crazy, ran out to the veranda
yelling --- `Boni! Saffia's gone out! Did you give him the pump? Did you?' And Boni woke up instantly, pulled the
precious pump from under his bed and rushed out with it. I went back to Glin, covered both of us with a blanket and
mumbled, `No-no-no'. I thought that if I kept on mumbling `no', it wouldn't happen. But then there was a huge
explosion. And then another and another. And everything started to shake.  Sirens wailed from all directions. And
suddenly Shouba appeared. And I let out a scream that has never stopped ---''

Zakod waits a minute and then says quietly, ``That night, when I came over to your
place,{ }it was for the first time after a very long absence. I had not been
back{ }to your place since that last heated clash between Saffia and myself
that ended in~a bitter falling-out. I walked out slamming the door behind me never to return. ~Some time passed since
then. And \textit{that night} I was suddenly hit by the idea that Saffia might indeed carry out his plan
\textit{imminently}. And I wanted to try once more to talk him out of it. Make another attempt using all my powers of
persuasion. I so loved him! I never loved anyone the way I loved him. I never shall. I went to your place and knocked
at the door. You opened it and set my heart at rest when you told me that Saffia had left for work. So I went back
home relieved.  It was on the way that I heard the explosions. I realized then that I should have trusted my
premonitions. So I ran to the citadel. By the time I got there they had cordoned off the area. I tied a white
handkerchief around my arm to look like First Aid. The whole place was in flames. Smoke. Walls collapsing, roofs caving
in. Where was Saffia? I ran about like a madman. It was a scene from hell. A blood bath. Just as I had predicted. In
the funeral six children and thirteen adults were buried as if individually to spare the families deeper grief.
Saffia's friends stood far back during the ceremony. It was whispered that he was among those buried in the mass grave
of the unidentified. \textit{But that was~not true}. I know what happened. That night --- heading with his loaded
bicycle to the citadel --- that night at long last he understood that no aspiration, no idea or ideal, can justify
killing, blindly murdering. And he found himself in the clutches of an excruciating inner strife. On the one hand, his
desire to execute his plan was gone, while on the other he did not have the strength of mind to admit to his friends
that his plan of action was basically, tragically, flawed. So he fled. Disappeared. That was his solution. Later, when
I heard that you had gone away with Glin, I concluded that you made arrangements to reunite at some distant place. But
as time elapsed and I heard about you being alone with Glin in that village up north, I reached another conclusion.
That night Saffia ran away from\textit{ you too}. He could not face you. It was then that I began to write to
you.''

``You're out of your mind,'' Rimat says under her breath, wondering why she's still sitting
opposite Zakod at~the same table. ``How do you explain the explosions in the citadel?''

``The citadel had an arsenal of ammunition. There was a mishap. A freak accident. Whenever such an accident
occurs, they always blame underground cells first. History is full of such examples.''

``You and your examples in history-''

``There are in history a few events that mirror Saffia's insoluble predicament,'' Zakod stands
his ground. ``Not many, but there \textit{are} some.''

Rimat freezes. Maybe there's a grain of truth in what Zakod says?
\linebreak[4]
``He{\ldots}he left me{\ldots}?'' she
manages to mutter. ``We had our disagreements. Even quarrels. He was an angel. I wasn't. To think he could be living a
different life? Another woman? Other children?'' She pulls herself together. ``No! No-no-no!
Saffia and I were one entity. Body and soul.  You can't understand this. You have a logical way of thinking that can't
be argued with. But you have no proof. And I'll tell you why you think this way. It's a dodge. Because you too are
guilty of what happened to Saffia. You stopped coming over because you didn't want to have any more of those fights
with Saffia. The luxury of a professor in Academia. You \textit{should've} continued to come over, keep on with those
bitter disagreements. \textit{To save Saffia from himself}. You are guilty. And Alir is guilty because he ran away to
write his poems. And Shouba is guilty because the bomb-timers he made were defective. And Boni is guilty because he
always hid that bicycle pump under his bed. And Michlor is guilty because he crammed for his exams instead of rushing
to give Saffia first aid. And Gidal is guilty because he was a yellow-belly from the word go.  You're all guilty.
Every one of you. And I too am guilty. That I didn't throw myself down on the front threshold and block his way out. I
was exhausted. Tired to death. Nursing Glin, his crying at night, the endless diapers. The only thing I wanted was to
sleep. Just sleep and sleep.''

``Are you still waiting for him?'' Zakod ventures. ``Only in books and films or
the theatre does a husband come back after eighteen years.''

``I'm not waiting for him,'' Rimat nods her head. ``I mourn him. I mourn him for
himself. I mourn him for me. I mourn him for Glin who could have had a father like Saffia. He didn't leave us. He died.
I don't know where. But he died. I can't prove it. I just know that he died.'' Rimat goes to the kitchen
door leading to the staircase and opens it to go downstairs.

``Rimat,'' Zakod says to her softly, ``we two are lonely people ---''

``I'm alone. But I'm not lonely.''


\chapter{}

She finally appears at the end of the path. At long last! His body has grown stiff from standing
tense{ }all this time looking out of the window. What's she holding in her
hands --- a basket? What's stopping him from running up to her?  He's afraid he'll trip over from overexcitement.

Aera walks in. ``Glin?'' She's looking for him.

He steals up from behind, puts his arms around her. They kiss.

``Aera ---''

``Glin ---''

``Aera ---''

``Glin ---''

``When Yamik told me you would be coming I went out of my mind ---''

``And I cry all the time. I was never like that, but now I can't help it.''

Glin licks her tears and then kisses her hair. ``Your tears are like pearls and your hair smells sweet
like milk,'' he mumbles.

``Some time ago I cut it because of you. Now I'm growing it again because of you.''

``Yamik'll soon be here,'' Glin says and then steps back, throws
out{ }his arms, flapping the baggy sleeves and pinching the loose material on
both sides, ``How do I look in Yamik's shirt? Like a scarecrow? ''

Aera laughs, ``Come on, put on some fat.'' She looks around. This room ---  like the rest of
the building and in fact the whole neighborhood --- is half-built. Resting on
a pair of trestles there's a rough wooden plank with two sets of Walkmans and earphones on it.

``Just a sec,'' Glin gently pushes them aside and Aera takes out a red and white checkered
tablecloth from the basket and spreads it over the plank. ``How are you?'' She asks.

``Hungry. And how are \textit{you}?''

``Starving.'' She deftly empties the basket of crockery, cutlery, food, drink and puts them on
the table.

``That basket is a horn of plenty!'' Glin exclaims at the set table. He brings over three
empty wooden crates to serve as chairs.

``Bon app\'etit!''

``Bon app\'etit!''

``Salute!''

``To you!''

They clink glasses and dig in. Acting like an unruly child Aera purposely lets bits of food spill down her front to
disguise the milk stains on her blouse.

Yamik, unobserved, approaches noiselessly in his commando boots, stops at the doorway, notices his wife dining cozily
with his close friend at the makeshift table. ``Hello, good friends!'' he greets them as he
enters the room.

They look up. ``Hello to you,{ }good{ }friend!'' they respond.

He comes up to them, removes{ }his military cap, takes off the rucksack and
unbuttons his shirt. He then lays a friendly hand on Glin's shoulder while being careful not to touch Aera.

``Go ahead and show Aera,'' Glin prods Yamik.

The short moment Yamik leans over towards Aera is sufficient for her to read the name engraved on the
dog-tag he's wearing, `Saffia, Glin', beneath it some seven-eight digits.

Glin points to the rucksack, ``Looks heavy ---''

``Civilian~surplus,'' Yamik winks.

Aera, quick on the uptake, asks, ``What's it for?''

``Contributions for the men,'' Yamik hastens to answer.

A furrow deepens on Aera's forehead, ``I thought you'd distanced yourself from them ---''

``It's always worthwhile keeping up some contact.''

``What for?''

``Aera,'' Yamik tries to curb his impatience, ``trust me.''

But Aera must verify, ``It doesn't have to do with
the TV building{\ldots}or does it?''

``Why on earth?'' Yamik is quick to put her mind at ease.

``Where do you keep it?''

``Deep in  the ground under those bushes,'' Yamik points outside.

``Look what Mother sent,'' she invites him to the makeshift table.

``Auntie's home cooking!'' he beams as he seats himself on the third crate.

``Are there any changes in the plan?'' Aera asks,

``Why aren't you eating?'' Yamik responds with a question.

``I've eaten,'' she says.

``Come on, Aera, eat some more!''

Doing her best to please him Aera forces a few forkfuls into her mouth. ``I asked if there're any
changes?''

``None whatsoever!'' Yamik is emphatic, and once again pleads with her, ``Eat up, drink up --- the more the better!''

Again she yields to his plea. Most of what she drinks spills down the front of her blouse till it's now one big wet
stain. She clears a space on the plank in front of her, and then takes a sheet of paper out from her basket and lays it
in front of her. ``This is the declaration I've drafted.''

Yamik bends down to scan it. ``Excellent,'' he says, turning his eyes to Glin who looks
askance.

Intercepting this mute back-and-forth between the two, Aera realizes that Glin knows nothing of Yamik's short nocturnal
visit to the shack after she'd sent him word about Baby's birth. Yamik rushed uphill and into the shack  drunk with
joy. He wanted to eat Baby up. And he{ }couldn't get enough of kissing her. ~Mother --- in her wisdom
--- had left the new parents to themselves for the short duration of his visit. Among the few words they managed to
exchange, Yamik had confided in her the details of the TV operation. And then made her a request. Since her knowledge
of the official language was far better than his, and since she was naturally far more familiar with the ideal of the
return to  Pale Blue Valley than Glin, he'd asked her to draft the declaration to be declaimed once they take over
the inauguration of the new TV auditorium. He told her he would send her a message via the men specifying when and
where to deliver it to him and Glin. She was delighted to be thus involved. As soon as Yamik left the shack she set to
work on her assignment{. }

``Where will he sit?'' she asks Yamik as though Glin isn't present.

Yamik produces a ticket from his shirt pocket, ``Here's his ticket.''

Aera takes the ticket and reads out loud, ``The Inauguration Ceremony of Public Television Network New
Auditorium. Row 7. Seat 15.''

``It's next to the aisle,'' Yamik explains.

Aera hands the ticket to Glin without looking at him and asks Yamik, ``And what happens after he finishes
reading the declaration?''

``What do you mean?''

Aera stifles her anger at this pretense of naivet\'e and is careful not to reveal her worry. ``How's he
supposed to get out of there?'' She asks.

``What's there to worry about?'' Glin cuts in{.}

Aera looks right through him, ``Won't you be apprehended?''

``I'll threaten them,'' Glin says. ``I'll warn them that they better leave me
alone, not follow me! I'll definitely threaten them!''

``With what?'' Aera mimics wide-eyed childlike curiosity.

``With{\ldots}'' Yamik interrupts with a slight stammer which he immediately overcomes,
``that's to say that if they do anything to Glin the whole world
is going to know about it! So many people
will be watching! Listening!''

``Just as well that you're telling me this,'' Aera says, ``because I need to add
it at the end of the declaration.'' She takes out a pen and writes down the necessary addition at the end
of the declaration she's drafted.

Yamik and Glin make eye contact.

Aera puts her pen back in her handbag, turns to Glin and asks perfunctorily, ``Where will you go after
you{\ldots}get out?''

``Yamik will leave a car for me in the next street,'' Glin says. ``I'll drive out
of town, then stop and get out of it at some previously agreed spot between me and Yamik, get into a car which Yamik
had left for me there, change clothes and identity card, drive further some distance, then slow down almost to a stop
and jump out. The car will roll along until it falls over the cliff edge. Total loss.''

Yamik takes over, ``Glin'll disappear there into a cave stocked with all the necessary provisions for a few
days{\ldots}''

``Among them a pile of my discs,'' Glin interjects with a chuckle.

Aera says, ``Vital for you.''

``And I'll join him a few hours later,'' Yamik again takes over. ``We stay
put~there for a couple of days. And then we'll get to another hiding place and then another. That's what we'll do for a
while. Nothing to worry about. How's my aunt doing?''

``She's fine,'' says Aera. ``She didn't go to work today.~ One of her nieces
asked her to baby-sit for her baby.''

``How is that baby doing?'' Yamik asks.

``Fine,'' Aera says.  ``He's coming along very-very nicely.''

Hardly curbing his emotions Yamik asks: ``Does he have a name yet?''

``Not yet,'' Aera says. ``They're waiting for his father to come home and help
choose a name for him together. Meanwhile{ }they call him Baby. Capital
B.''

``Let's hope Baby's father comes home soon,'' Yamik utters the words slowly and
then carries on matter-of-factly, ``I have to leave here in quarter of an hour. I'm a candidate for
the title of `Selected Recruit' and I mustn't endanger it by getting back late to the base. I can~walk you to the
bus station later.'' He turns to Glin and points at the rucksack, ``Would you
---''

Glin heaves the rucksack onto~his shoulder, takes hold of a shovel{ }propped up
in the corner and goes out.

Yamik and Aera are now alone together. He buttons his uniform. She collects the~dishes and the pieces of cutlery, folds
the tablecloth, puts everything back in the basket. Only the sheet of paper remains on the rough wooden plank.

Outside dirt{ }is being hacked and shoveled.

``He'll do anything for you,'' Yamik says. ``He's not a standup comedian
with{ }only music in his head.''

Aera says, ``What's going to happen to him afterwards? On \textit{their} side he'll obviously be burnt out ---''

``I'm thinking about it,'' says Yamik. He wishes
Aera~would{ }stop needling him on the subject.

Aera, afraid she may be too open about this worry of hers, tries to sound indifferent, ``I'm sure you'll
find a way.'' She scrutinizes Yamik's face trying to guess what's going on inside his head.  Plucking up
courage she asks bluntly, ``Were you together with the men in the bus operation?''

Yamik gulped. `` I{\ldots}well, I was around there ---''

``So you did make contact with the men ---'' she wants to look at
him{ }straight in his eyes but he averts them. ``Why do I keep
asking you questions that I don't know whether you yourself believe in your answers.''

``Oh, Aera, it's too complicated,'' Yamik sighs. ``Were I to detach myself
altogether, they'd forever be snooping after me. In that case I certainly wouldn't be able to act independently. I'll
send you a message the first possible moment.'' Resting his elbows on the now bare plank of wood he holds
his head in his hands. ``I'm tired, my love. I want to be home. With you. I want
us{ }to choose a name for our baby \textit{together}.''

Aera knows that this is the moment she should grant Yamik the warm hug he deserves, but she doesn't make a move. And
now that Glin has just at this moment returned with the shovel and the empty rucksack, she's missed the moment she
could have \textit{not} missed, that she \textit{should} \textit{not} have missed. She hopes Yamik didn't sense that
when he asks her as if continuing their chat, ``Did you bump into any problems getting
here?''

``The bus was stopped twice,'' Aera answers. ``Once at some place along the
highway and once entering town. They searched the basket but didn't pay any attention to the declaration. They took it
for a bit of scrap paper.'' After a brief pause she asks, ``What exactly will the two of you
be doing at the ceremony?''

``What needs to be done,'' Yamik is quick to answer.

``Show me ---''

``Glin and I have been through it more than enough times already.''

``But I won't be there,'' Aera pouts like a peeved little girl, ``Didn't I
draft the declaration? Don't I deserve to see how it's going to be declaimed?''

``Okay,'' Yamik yields to her.

To clear some space the two  men push away the three crates, the wooden plank and the
trestles{.} Yamik points with his hand, ``Let's say that the stage
is over there. The dais is in the middle. The CEO and the MC and some VIP's sit behind it. The stand with the mike
--- this spade --- is over here. The audience is over there. Glin sits in row 7 next to the aisle. The ceremony
begins.''

``Wait a sec ---'' Aera interrupts him. ``What happens if something goes wrong
at the last minute and you're not where you're supposed to be?''

``There's~a safety valve,'' Glin takes over. ``First thing I do when I reach the
TV building I pass by Yamik to check that he's there. Only then do I continue into the building.''

``Throughout all this Glin and I will naturally be in contact --- he inside and I outside ---  by means of
our communications system,'' Yamik adds.

Aera asks him, ``Where will you actually be standing?''

``Behind the building,'' Yamik says. ``I'll be~the only one posted
there.  May we please go on?''

Aera nods graciously.

``So this is the setup,'' Yamik resumes his description. ``Glin is in his seat
with the earphones on, removing them from time to time.''

Glin, sitting on one of the crates, his Walkman in place, demonstrates Yamik's description of him. He explains,
``This is so the{ }people around me get used to this weird
character who can't do without his Walkman even during the ceremony. I'll also whisper something~to that effect to
whoever is lucky enough to sit next to me.''

Yamik takes hold of~the other Walkman and puts on his earphones, ``I'm now walking to the spot behind the
building where I'm stationed.'' He walks away towards the end of the room and almost disappears in the
dark there. His voice carries from there, ``Glin, can you hear me?''

Glin says, ``Yes.''

``Give me the sign ---''

Glin clears his throat three times.

``Good,'' Yamik confirms and then continues, ``let's say that about half an hour
has elapsed since the beginning of the ceremony. I now count ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one,
zero{\ldots}''

Glin dashes to the makeshift stage and grabs the{ }spade-cum-microphone. He takes a sheet of paper out
of his pocket, flattens it and starts to read aloud, ``Ladies and gentlemen, please permit me to present
the{\ldots}''

``Hold on!'' Aera interrupts him, ``What are you reading?''

``The declaration,'' says Glin.

``But that's not the declaration I drafted ---'' Aera turns to look at Yamik but he's busy
checking his watch. ``I didn't know you too had drafted a declaration,'' Aera addresses Glin
who is watching Yamik perplexed.

``He did it for our practice,'' Yamik explains.

``So let's compare them ---'' Aera suggests in a spirit of camaraderie.

``Oh, no ---'' Glin folds his piece of paper and inserts it in his pocket.

``Oh, yes ---'' she presses.

``Time's running out!'' Yamik announces~impatiently from the far the end of the room.
``It's getting late!''

Aera ignores Yamik and begs Glin, ``I'd really like to ---''

``But I'd rather not,'' he says.

``Why?''

``I'm embarrassed ---''

``About what?''

``My spelling mistakes.''

Aera laughs, ``In your own mother tongue?''

``I was a slow learner and still am ---''

``So let's compare our mistakes --- in that case!''

``There you are,'' Yamik intrudes, emerging from the dark, ``now you have a picture of
what's going to happen. Let's go. I'll jeopardize my citation of `Selected Recruit' if I'm late.''
He picks up Aera's basket, hands it to her and gives Glin his last instructions, ``Take a clean shave.
Comb your hair. Put on the jacket I brought you. And don't forget the tie.''

``I'll be the picture of elegance,'' Glin smiles. They shake hands. This is the last time they
see each other before the operation. On impulse they hug. Glin says, ``I never had a friend like you ---''

``Neither did I ---'' Yamik responds and hurries to add,
``I almost forgot~---'' he takes a picture postcard from his shirt pocket and
gives it to Aera, hanging onto her hand for another
precious second. ``Guess what it is ---''

Aera takes a swift look at{ }the card, ``I've no idea.''

``It's a photo of Pale Blue Valley.''

``How did you come by it?''

``They gave us a tour of their National Library. In the photocopy department we could each ask for a copy
of a photo of our choice. So I leafed through some of their history albums --- and found this.''

``The colors are too bright, too glossy.''

``No matter,'' Yamik is disturbed by Area's reservation. ``Please give it to my
auntie.''

``No way. She'd be very vexed that it's not like the real thing. You know how she is.''

``Auntie will understand and be happy with it,'' Yamik insists, ``I too know how
she is.''

Aera complies.

Having pushed the Walkman and the earphones into his empty rucksack he now slings the bag on his shoulder, puts on his
army cap with a flourish, stands to attention and gives Glin a comical salute. He checks his watch, ``I
still have few minutes to look around. I've done my share of toil and sweat here, right?'' Turning to Aera
he tells her, ``I'll wait for you at the roundabout.''

Aera gets his hint: he's leaving her and Glin to say their goodbyes in his absence and while at it do her best to
encourage Glin in his critical task in the TV operation.

It also gives Aera a few more minutes alone with her beloved who already has his arms around her. They kiss.

``Just imagine that we're after all that ---'' Area says and suddenly realizes she's forgotten
to bring along that faded photo for Glin to identify that man --- face puffy, hair disheveled, eyes unfocussed. Hopefully
she won't forget to bring it next time they meet. May that be sooner than soon.



\chapter{}

``Here's your ticket,'' Alir hands the ticket to Shouba. ``It's called
`A Complimentary Ticket'. So feel properly honored.''

``I'll try and rise to the occasion.'' Shouba says as he scans the ticket. ``I
planned to listen to it over the radio, Maybe even watch it on TV if I get around to fixing that old piece
of~junk.''

``I'll be offended if you don't come,'' Alir says.

``I shall certainly come,'' Shouba promises. ``Shall we run through it
again?''

``No,'' Alir shakes his head. ``I've reached a point where any
more rehearsing will only destroy the bit of self-confidence that you've managed to instill in me.''

``Let's drink to your success!'' Shouba goes to the kitchen to make tea and calls from there,
``What you decided to say about the third line is perfect. It's like a further experiment that reconfirms
previous results.''

Alir says, ``If it gets to Rimat, it might convince her.''

``It most certainly will,'' Shouba peers into the room with the tea kettle in hand.

``When I wrote the poem ---'' Alir reflects, ``it simply burst out of me. Like a geyser.''

``I remember,'' Shouba says. ``You wrote it~here as we watched~the evacuation of
the Balads on TV. That little girl crying over her doll~that slipped from her hands and fell to the ground ---''

``Now,'' Alir explains, ``when I thought about the third line quietly, from a
distance, and planned to correct it, change it, and at the end decided to let it be, I feel that I grew up. That I
matured. That at long last~I reached my age. Now I feel to be deserving of Saffia's friendship.''

Shouba nods in agreement while placing the kettle on a pile of hand-me-downs. The kettle sinks dangerously into the
depression it makes. He hastens to grab it before it topples over. He looks for a more secure place for it.
``Listen, I want to tell you what occurred to me about what happened to Saffia,'' he says
when he finally entrusts the kettle to the window sill. ``Do you remember what Zakod used to tell him?
That he'd be blamed for a blood bath?''

``I don't ---''

``This is what he used to tell him. All the time. A blood bath. A slaughter house.'' Shouba
stops. When he speaks again he's uttering each word separately, ``So maybe at the end, when Saffia~was
on the point of setting the bomb-timer{\ldots}perhaps{\ldots}at that last moment{\ldots}\textit{he in fact did set off
the bombs}{\ldots}''

``What do you mean{\ldots}?'' Alir is creasing his forehead.

``That he activated the bombs and \textit{remained there}{\ldots}''

Alir and Shouba look at each other. They bow their heads, eyes closed.


\chapter{}

``As for hiring new employees in this establishment,{}'' explains the CEO as he winds up the meeting with
the group of `Selected Recruits', ``we advertise in the newspapers when the need arises. But it does happen that
someone comes along on his own initiative, asks for an interview, describes his experience, his interests, presents his
CV, his portfolio, and sometimes he'll be hired --- to the satisfaction of all concerned.''

``For example,'' interjects Ezlip sitting next to the CEO, ``about a decade or so
ago a young man came by, said that he dabbled in photography, brought along his portfolio of photographs --- and the rest
is history.''

One of the soldiers raises his hand, ``Was it you?''

Ezlip says, ``Close, but not quite ---''

The recruits smile, some of them chuckle{.}

Bonimi feels a bit embarrassed. ``From this you may assume that I was a failure as a
photographer,'' he owns up, pursing his lips.

The soldiers applaud.

The phone rings. Ezlip picks up the receiver, speaks softly for a minute, covers the mouthpiece and whispers to the CEO,
``It's Janha. The chairman of Chamber of Commerce is waiting outside.''

Bonimi whispers back, ``Just a few more minutes.''

Ezlip relays the message to Janha in a whisper and replaces the receiver.

``It seems that unfortunately I have to bring this most pleasant get-together to an
end,'' Bonimi addresses the `Selected Recruits' in a personable tone of voice, ``They're
breathing down my neck. I hope you've been told that there are complimentary tickets for you for
tomorrow's ceremony inaugurating our renovated auditorium.''

Ezlip fills in, ``You can get them at the information desk in the lobby. The receptionist will be glad to
oblige.''

Bonimi takes over, ``Let me wish you one and all a safe term of duty.''

The recruits smile and get up. One by one they file by the CEO and his aide to~shake hands on the way out.

As he shakes hands with each recruit Bonimi reads the name affixed to his lapel out loud and exchanges a few words
with him. His heart almost stops when the moment arrives. ``Selected Recruit Saffia, Glin ---'' he reads out his nephew's
name as he slowly, deliberately, shakes Yamik's large strong{ }hand, ``any
plans for after your service?''

Yamik answers, ``I'd like to go into audio-engineering, sir.''

``You might join us here in this establishment,'' Bonimi smiles. ``Thank you,
sir,'' says Yamik and continues on his way to the door.

Bonimi{ }stops{ }him with a light touch on the arm, ``We share a surname ---''

``A common surname harbors both threat and hope,'' Yamik responds lightly.

Bonimi is intrigued by the fact that Glin isn't curious about their common surname. He studies his face intently,
searching for some resemblance to Saffia, to Rimat, to branches of their families. He forces himself to find some. He
says, ``I'm sure your family{ }is proud of you ---'' hoping that Glin will
come up with some details~about Rimat --- where she lives, maybe she remarried, has more children.

``They are,'' Yamik says. ``Thank you, sir. Our tour of the TV building was most
interesting. And we all really appreciate the time you took to meet with us. Good afternoon.''

``All the best to you,'' Bonimi salutes him. The tinge of a Balad accent in the young man's
speech sets him wondering. He won't allude to it of course.

Yamik returns his salute, turns and leaves, closing the door behind him.

The silence of the room clashes head-on with~Bonimi's inner tempest.

``You outdid yourself today,'' Ezlip compliments the CEO. ``I don't remember
ever having such a successful meeting with any group of those `Selected Recruits'. You were so personable, open,
spontaneous. You outdid yourself.''

The CEO spreads his arms dismissively.

Ezlip slips several documents into his briefcase.\textbf{ }

The CEO dares to guess, ``Source material for a book about our chapter in history?''

``On the button,'' Ezlip replies, shutting his briefcase with a click.

``How about calling it The Last Renovation?'' suggests the CEO.

``An apt title,'' says Ezlip, adding, ``I can barely wait for
tomorrow!''

``At long last ---'' Bonimi sighs with relief. ``I'll be happy when it's over and
we go back to our blessed routine.''


\chapter{}

The elderly guard points to the~small TV screen on Shisha's information desk, ``The auditorium is starting
to fill up{\ldots}Oh, for God's sake!'' A young woman is wheeling a~baby's carriage into~the lobby
through the main entrance. He rushes over to stop her. ``Sorry,
ma'am, but babies aren't allowed in here now,'' he says politely.

Aera is flushed and sweating. ``You must help me,'' she almost orders the elderly guard.
``You must \textit{urgently} find the baby's father who's inside the auditorium and tell him to come out
\textit{immediately}!''

The elderly guard's heart softens instantly, ``Have you any idea where he's sitting?''

``Row 7 near the aisle. I don't know which side. He's very thin and wears a Walkman and
earphones.''

``Have a seat meantime, ma'am,'' the old guard points to a bench near the bulletin board and runs to bring
the distraught young woman a glass of water. In their short exchange he couldn't help noticing her slight Balad accent.
Brushing suspicion aside he hastens to the auditorium to look for the baby's father.

Shisha's eyes dart for a second to the woman with{ }the carriage and then
return to the TV screen.

Hardly a minute passes before Glin rushes out of the hall, frantic. What happened? Who could be asking for him? He
swiftly surveys the lobby. Aera! He rushes over to her. ``Aera!''

``You \textit{have} to get out!'' Aera orders him in a whisper.
``Run!''

Glin whispers back, alarmed{, }{}``What are you doing here?!''

``They're going to kill you!''

Meanwhile the elderly guard has returned to Shisha's desk. ``Shhh{\ldots}'' she motions to Glin
and Aera. She and the elderly guard exchange{ u}neasy looks at the~family~tiff
they are privy to at the far end of the lobby.\textbf{ }

``You must \textit{not} go to the cave!'' Aera whispers to Glin.
``They're setting an ambush for you there! They're going to kill you!''

Glin is confused. ``Who?''

``Our men!''

Glin doesn't believe her, can't believe her.  ``What does Yamik say?''

``It's out of his hands now! Get out! Run! ''

Glin recoils, ``No way!'' How can he not carry out~all of Yamik's precise instructions?

Aera points at the baby in the carriage, ``This is our baby! Run! For our son's sake!''

``\textit{Our }baby?'' Glin is stunned.

``I{\ldots}I didn't tell you. I couldn't ---'' she stutters.

He now recognizes his old cradle in this renovated baby carriage.
He peers into it, glimpses a small head with baby hair, a little body
swathed in a bed sheet printed with pale blue flowers. By sheer force he steps back.
``Aera,'' he says, a tremor in his voice, ``I'm part of Yamik's plan. I cannot
leave.''

``I'm going straight over to Yamik right now. He'll order you to get out!''

At the information desk Shisha again motions to the couple to keep their voices down.

``You're imagining things,'' Glin loses patience with Aera. ``You are in the
way!''

Aera is already outside running for all her worth. She suddenly remembers that faded photo of the man she had slipped
into the pouch attached to the carriage to show to Glin later --- face puffy, hair uncombed, eyes unfocused. Another
time.

Glin hurries back into the auditorium.

``Look, look!'' Shisha draws the elderly guard's attention, ``that woman ran
outside and left her baby behind!''

The elderly guard is about to go after Aera, but stops short when he sees the MC of the ceremony emerging from the
auditorium followed by the CEO.

``I can't, Boni, I can't ---'' Alir shakes his head, ``Everything's gone blank in my mind. I
just can't ---''

``But it's all going so well,'' Bonimi encourages this overgrown boy as he takes hold of his
hand to pull him back to the auditorium.

``No, no,'' Alir moans, not budging.

Shisha fills a glass of water from the decanter on her desk and hands it to the CEO.

The CEO makes a mental note to insert a few words about her solicitude in her employee file in the Human Resources
department.  ``It's from over-excitement,'' he explains to her, handing the glass to Alir
who absent-mindedly downs the water in one gulp. It dribbles from his mouth onto his elegant jacket rented for the
occasion.  With his ever-ready neat handkerchief Bonimi pats him dry, and with the merest nod indicates to Shisha to
lower the volume of the TV.

Oblivious to all Alir~lets out a cry, ``Rimat is in the auditorium ---''

``Rimat!?'' Bonimi is flabbergasted.

``She's waiting for me to correct the third line,'' Alir explains as if it's self-evident,
``and I'm completely mixed up{\ldots}I forgot what the correction was~---''

``Look!'' Shisha points to the screen.

Bonimi turns his eyes to the screen and asks Alir, ``Who's that young man?''

Alir glances mechanically at the screen, ``No idea ---''

``What a performer!'' Bonimi beams with delight. ``The way he so naturally leapt
from his seat in the auditorium and ran to the podium to grab the mike!'' He puts his arm round Alir's
shoulder, ``Let's just wait until this part's over and then we'll go back inside.''

Alir shakes his head vigorously.

Bonimi's eyes are glued to the screen, ``He's reading something out ---'' he turns to Shisha,
``could you please turn up the volume?''

On the screen Glin is seen reading aloud from a sheet of paper, ``And this is why we want to explain our
demand to everyone, to the audience~in this auditorium, to~TV viewers, to radio listeners. We demand to be able to
return to the place where our fathers and forefathers lived for generations --- to our Pale Blue Valley! We will rebuild
our homes there and no longer be{\ldots}''

The CEO turns pale. He orders Shisha in almost a shout, ``The intercom to the
chief of transmission!'' Once the phone is in his hand he steadies his voice:

``This is Bonimi Saffia, the CEO of Public Television Network speaking,'' he identifies
himself and then raps out his instructions: ``Stop external transmission immediately. Announce a technical
hitch. Show some series of clips from last year's song fest. Continue transmission in closed circuit only to me down
here at the information desk and to Security. These are Balads. They've hijacked~the ceremony.''

The screen that went dark for a minute now lights up. Glin is seen again, reading from the sheet of paper,
``I repeat the warning: the TV building is booby-trapped with multiple explosives.  If we do not receive
\textit{within half an hour} a clearly stated~assurance from an authoritative source that our demand will be met,
\textit{these explosives will be detonated}. If anyone tries to lay a hand on me, detain me, harm me in any way,
\textit{the explosives will be detonated}. Once we get this assurance, I shall leave the auditorium. Unless I am given
complete free exit, unaccompanied and without{ }being followed, \textit{the
explosives will be detonated}. The half-hour countdown begins{\ldots}Now!''

Shisha, the security guard and the CEO stare at each other wide-eyed. In a trice their shock changes into a
realization. The horrific experience of others ---  what they've read about in the papers and heard on the radio and
watched on TV  --- is happening right now and here \textit{to them}. Shisha bites her lower lip so hard that it
starts to bleed. Spots of blood dot her blouse. Putting her hands on her chest makes a mess of them. The elderly
guard can barely breathe. Bonimi clenches his fists. Alir is locked in his own world, oblivious to all around.

The auditorium door is flung open, Ezlip rushes over to the CEO.

Glin's voice is heard on TV, ``The explosives will be detonated if any other person leaves the auditorium.
I demand complete silence in the auditorium.''

The CEO updates Ezlip about~the instructions he gave to the chief of transmission and adds, ``I'm sure
Security is already in control.'' He turns to Shisha, ``The mike to the auditorium, please~---''

Shisha's hands tremble as she does his bidding.

The CEO's voice is heard over the system, ``This is Bonimi Saffia, Public Television Network CEO. Ladies
and gentlemen in the auditorium, please stay calm. The situation is under control. Official negotiations are about
to begin. I'd like to request that the
half-hour countdown begin now. Is that confirmed?''

Silence.

The CEO repeats his request, ``I would like to receive a confirmation for my request that the half-hour
countdown begin \textit{now}.''

After another moment of silence Yamik's voice responds loud and clear, ``Confirmation
granted.''

The CEO says ``Thank you.'' He turns off the mike. ``This is a new voice,'' he
tells Ezlip. ``This guy is{ }obviously the one in charge. Security must
be{ }locating him.'' Bonimi turns the mike on. ``I request that elderly
people, women and children be allowed to leave the auditorium ---''

Yamik's response is immediate, ``Request denied.''

The CEO again turns off the mike and draws Ezlip's attention to the young Balad standing on the podium. ``Looks like
he's also waiting for instructions.'' He then speaks over the audio system, ``I request that
children and elderly people be allowed to leave the auditorium ---''

A second passes before Yamik's voice is heard, ``Request denied.''

The CEO says, ``I request that children be allowed to leave the auditorium~---''

Two seconds pass before Yamik's voice is heard again, ``Request denied.''

The CEO says, ``I request that the half-hour countdown begin now ---''

Yamik's voice is heard immediately, ``Request confirmed.''

The CEO turns off the system, nods his head in the direction of the TV screen and then turns
to Ezlip, ``For the life of me I'd never guess that that young
fellow there on the stage is a Balad. He looks like one of us. Speaks like one of us too.'' At the
same time he wonders why that new voice coming over the sound system --- with its mixture of accents --- sounds so
familiar. Whose could it be? When did he happen to hear it?

The phone on the information desk rings.  Ezlip picks up the receiver and hands it to the CEO, ``The
Chief-of-Staff ---''


\chapter{}

Hidden in the shadows behind the television building Yamik suddenly sees his wife racing towards him.

``Aera? What in God's name are you doing here?!'' He confronts her. ``You must get away at
once!''

``The men{\ldots}are going{\ldots}to kill Glin!'' She's panting.

``What?{ }Are you crazy?'' That's all he can
say.  How does she know?

Then, in a flash, the pieces fit together: the men had visited the shack and talked. She'd learned they were party to
his planned operation in the TV building and knew of Glin's involvement.

``Yamik, who will get to that cave first?''

``Glin.''

``So Glin will be at their mercy!'' Aera drops all pretense.

Yamik hears her desperate words but they don't register. All he wants is that this hour, this day should be over, and
that he and she and the baby will be together at last. But Glin's leanness, vulnerability and trust, pain him to the
core{.}

 ``No,'' he says{ }confidently,
``no, it won't happen, but ---''

``But what?'' Aera hisses.

``It's too complicated,'' he says, ``no time to explain. Just get away!
Now!''

``Did you give them the green light?'' Aera insists. ``Yes or no?''

Yamik repeats once again, ``It's too complicated.'' He
cannot{ }share with Aera what happened between himself and the men, can't tell
her they had decided to do away with Glin after the operation. That was how he'd come up with the idea of the cave and
convinced them of its practicality.  At the time he'd reckoned on his reaching the cave before they did, and one way
or another protect Glin. But how? For how long? He'd then~put~these questions aside for the moment.

``You promised me,'' Aera fixes her eyes on his and they're both aware that she's alluding to
the promise he gave her after the business of the limping gatekeeper in that village.

``You must get away from here!'' Yamik pleads, ``At
once!''

``Not before you promise me that you won't let them touch Glin!''

``Alright, alright! Just get away, Aera{. T}he building is
booby-trapped ---''

``So you \textit{did}{ }plant those explosives?''

``It was necessary.
You mustn't be in the way. \textit{Just go}!''

``Baby's in there!''

``\textit{Inside the~ building!?}''

``Yes!''

``You brought him? Are you out of your mind?!''

``I couldn't leave him alone{. } Mother was at
work.''

\textit{``Get him out of there! Now! Go!'' }

``I'm staying with you. And when I see Glin leave the building, I'll go with him to the
cave.''



\chapter{}

Ezlip hands the receiver to the CEO. ``The Prime Minister's security aide.''

``Bonimi Saffia speaking,'' Bonimi identifies himself, listens, then responds,
``Very well, sir ---'' he returns the receiver to Ezlip and updates him, ``Special
Squad is moving in. They've intercepted radio contact between that Balad in the auditorium and somebody
outside.''

Yamik's voice is heard over the system, ``There's a baby carriage in the lobby with a baby inside. It
should be wheeled out.''

The CEO and Ezlip turn to look at the elderly security{ }guard who's pointing
at the baby carriage over in the lobby. The CEO's voice comes over: ``What do we get in
return?''

``First, the carriage must be wheeled out.''

Ezlip gestures to the CEO to respond in the negative. Bonimi ignores him and asks over the system, ``Does
this time span extend beyond the limit?''

``It does,'' answers Yamik{.}

The CEO covers the mouthpiece and asks, ``Who's baby is it?''

The elderly guard is all too ready to respond, ``A young{ }woman
wheeled him into the lobby a short time ago and insisted that I fetch his father from the auditorium right
away.''

Yamik's voice is heard, ``The baby carriage should be wheeled out as far as the supermarket in the new
mall.''

The CEO gestures to Shisha~to wheel the baby carriage out. She rubs her blood-spotted fingers nervously as she leaves
the information desk. It's the first time she's ever touched a~baby carriage. The elderly guard opens the door for her.

The CEO turns to Ezlip, ``No point haggling over terms of exchange now that
the Special Squad has been
activated.'' Over the speakers he says,
``We expect the countdown to be adjusted accordingly ---''

``It will be,'' Yamik's voice is heard. ``It will begin the moment the baby
carriage reaches{ }the designated place.''

The voice coming over intrigues Bonimi again and again. Its mixture of accents sounds so familiar.

All eyes are fixed on the screen.{ }Bonimi, Ezlip and the elderly guard watch
the skinny Balad standing motionless on the podium, his fingers nervously tapping the microphone, his neck rubbing
against the collar of his jacket as if it{'}s uncomfortable.

The phone buzzes. Ezlip picks up the receiver, listens briefly and puts it down. ``The Chief Of Staff would
like you to know that he's highly impressed by your presence of mind,'' he tells the CEO.

``A vital piece of information,'' Bonimi responds wryly.

Yamik's voice is heard, ``The half-hour countdown
begins{\ldots}NOW!''

``Look!'' The elderly guard cries out.

Alir stirs from his torpor, gets up from his chair and joins him and the CEO and Ezlip who are staring intently at the
TV screen.

``Who's that woman walking over to the stage?'' Ezlip asks.

``That's Rimat!'' Alir gasps.

Bonimi stares open-mouthed at the woman making her way towards the stage, ``Our
Rimat{\ldots}?''

Glin's voice is heard over the system, ``Mom, what the hell are you doing here?'' Then
he's seen stepping down from the podium and tripping over. Strange crackles
are emitted from the TV set.

Ezlip understands. ``The bloody fool got entangled in wires! It's going to{\ldots}''

``Glin!'' Yamik's voice booms{ }out,
``Glin!!!''

Yamik's cry is lost in the resounding blast that rocks the building.

\chapter{}

Mother is weeding the flower bed. Footsteps are heard coming up the hill, getting closer. She hopes against hope that
it's Gidal and{ }no one else. It is! She straightens up and waves.

He waves back. ``It's him!'' he calls out.

Mother's hands tremble. She waits until Gidal~closes the distance~between them and only then
asks,{ }``Are you sure?''

``Yes!'' Gidal almost jumps for joy. ``Absolutely sure!''

Mother doesn't trust this man who is only guided by the goodness of his heart. ``How can you be so sure?'' she asks.

``His carriage stood outside and I recognized it immediately ---'' Gidal can hardly contain
himself. ``Because of that pouch that your daughter attached to its handle and the metal frame with wheels
which it was mounted on.''

Needless to say he doesn't breathe a word about having recognized the cradle the moment he saw it in the shack. Cradles
do look alike, but there is no doubt about this one being baby Glin's old cradle. Hadn't he replaced the worn handles
with new ones at the time? How happy Rimat and Saffia had been with his handiwork. They couldn't thank him
enough{. }And it was in that very cradle that Rimat had
brought{ }Glin to the village that night when she came looking for him. And
later on, when Glin outgrew it, she'd turned it into her sewing basket. Hadn't he seen it whenever he stopped
by{ }at{ }her place? Aera said she'd picked it up at the flea market. But he has
another idea about how it found its way into her hands. About that too, of course,~he keeps silent.

``And{\ldots}\textit{the little one}?'' Mother tries to~steady her voice. ``Did
you see him?''

``Only from a distance.''

``How does he look?''

``He's filled out and he's smiling.''

``\textit{He's filled out and he{'}s smiling},'' Mother echoes Gidal's words as
she vacillates between belief and disbelief. ``How did you get in?''

``The way you told me,'' Gidal answers and carries on, ``I said that I want to
speak with the matron of the nursery. They told me to wait in the corridor outside her office. So I waited. Then they
opened the door and invited me in. So I went in. There was a woman there and I figured she must be the matron. I said
what you told me to say, that sometime soon my daughter is due to give birth as a single mother, and that she would
like to give up her baby for adoption, which is why we're looking for a~nursery that will take good care of the little
one and find him a good home. I told her what you told me to say. So~the matron asked a nurse to show me around.~ And
then, in another corridor, I saw the~carriage standing near an open door. I asked if I may go into that room and the
nurse said yes. There were four babies there and a couple of nurses. And one of the nurses was holding\textit{ our
}baby in her arms. I was sure it was him because I recognized the bed sheet he was covered with. It was printed with
pale blue flowers. I looked at him and could easily see that he'd filled out and he was smiling. ''

Mother, still hovering between belief and disbelief, again{ }echoes
``\textit{He's filled out and he was smiling}.''

``Yes,'' Gidal beams, delighted to be the bearer of such good tidings.

``Anyone followed you?''

``No one ---''

Suspicious{ }Mother doesn't trust him. How can he be so sure? Maybe people
\textit{on their side} associate Baby with what happened. Maybe they're waiting for someone to ask about him, show an
interest. She stops right there. She mustn't share her anxieties with this good-hearted man.

``Did you ask the matron how long it usually takes them to find good adoptive homes for these
babies?'' she asks.

``I asked her. She said that it usually takes about a year.''

``A year!'' Mother cries in despair.

``But in some cases it happens sooner,'' Gidal is happy to encourage her.

``There's hope.''

``There is.''

``And~you'll keep your eyes and ears open. All the time.''

``I will.''

``And the young woman{\ldots}who saved him?'' Mother asks anxiously, ``How is she
doing?''

``She's still in hospital.''

Mother is fearful.  She asks, ``Does she claim{ }that the baby is hers?''

``No. In the papers they said that she's single, that she never married, that she never had
children.''

Plucking up the courage Mother asks, dreading the answer,
``Has she got her memory back?''

``Not yet.''

``And Baby doesn't yet have a memory.'' Suddenly a new fear pierces Mother's heart.
``Has \textit{anybody }come to claim~Baby?''

``No.''

``How do you know?''

``How do I know{\ldots}?'' Gidal stammers, ``I assume that it would be
\linebreak[4]
\hbox{known ---''}

``By what means?'' asks Mother.

``They would talk about it on the radio, on TV,'' Gidal reassures Mother, ``write
 about it in the papers ---''

``You're right,'' Mother agrees. ``I can't begin to tell you how grateful I am
for what you're doing. And for keeping quiet about it. You do keep quiet, don't you?''

``I keep quiet.''

Mother fills the watering can. ~Gidal relieves it from her and waters the flowers. Since the disaster he's been coming
here almost daily. By now he knows how much water each flower needs.

But Mother doesn't trust him altogether. ``Add some more here,'' she advises him,
``that's quite~enough over there.''

``The flowers are doing nicely,'' Gidal says cheerfully.

``Aera always wanted a flowerbed here. You told me they buried her in the mass grave~for the unidentified.
But this is her real grave.'' She~doesn't tell Gidal that Aera always wanted to have pale blue flowers
grown here, but so far she hasn't found the right seedlings. It's too intimate. ``Back in a
minute,'' she excuses herself and disappears inside the shack.

Done with the watering Gidal washes his hands at the outside tap, seats himself on the bench and leans back
comfortably~against the wall. Mother reappears carrying a tray of food which she places on a low table in front of him.
She sits down next to him. They're accustomed to sharing an evening meal.

``Everything tastes so delicious as always,'' Gidal says, ``thank
you.''

Mother asks, ``Do they ask about Aera in the village?''

``No,'' says Gidal. ``They believe she's here with you and Baby.''

``Life is weighing down on me like a millstone,'' Mother sighs. ``A few of our
men came by yesterday asking about her. I said she'd gone to the market. They told me they had come to see her the day
before the explosion of the TV building. I've been thinking --- maybe she went to town that day because of something they
had told her? ~One thing I'm sure of --- she could have asked me to stay with Baby, but she didn't because she didn't
want me to know she was planning to go into town. She had her reasons and I'll never know them.'' After a moment's
silence she says, ``The boss at the packing house told me that the woman who lived in the village with her
only son --- who always wore a Walkman and earphones around his neck --- that they~too were among those killed in
the explosion. The mother inside the building and the son outside.''

Gidal is silent. What could he tell her about his own grief?

Mother continues, ``The boss told me that you loved that woman. For years and years. Forgive me for saying
it. I just want you to know that I know.''

Gidal is quiet. He has a good feeling about Mother knowing of his love for Rimat.

``I well remember her son,'' Mother continues. ``He~wasn't like the other
youngsters in your village. He would come to the packing shed and make Aera laugh. I was cross with Aera about this.
Now I'm happy about it. At least she laughed a little before she{\ldots}''

Gidal yields to temptation, ``I once saw them walking together ---'' he says quietly.

``You never did!'' Mother silences him.

Gidal continues, ``Outside the fence ---''

Mother hisses emphatically through clenched teeth, ``\textit{No, you did not!}''

``But I did,'' Gidal insists obtusely.

Mother silences him adamantly, ``\textit{You never did! Never}!''

Gidal finally catches on. ``No,'' he shakes his head, ``No, I never saw them. Never.''

``Aera was a strong young woman. Aera had a good head on her shoulders. Aera knew what's right and what's
wrong.'' Mother, sensing she was too vehement earlier, softens her voice, ``Treat yourself to
another helping ---''

``Thank you, but I had enough.''

``I don't prepare all this food just for myself. It's for the two of us.''

Gidal gives in and helps himself to another wedge of cheese. Suddenly he can no longer contain
himself.  ``Where's Baby's father?'' he blurts out.

``He had to go away some place for some time,'' answers Mother. ``This happens to
our men not infrequently. Every day that he doesn't return spares him the grief over Aera. Every day he doesn't return
deprives him of the happiness about Baby's survival.''

Meantime the sun has sunk below the horizon.

Gidal feels good about the darkness enveloping the two of them. ``I had one night of happiness in my
life,'' he says. ``That woman that I loved had once spent a night at my place and she nursed
her baby.  And the{ }one day\textit{ }of happiness in my life was the day I
came here and Aera nursed Baby.''

Mother says, ``I had many days of happiness and many nights of happiness, but they're all gone for me
forever. Like they're gone for you forever. The main part of our lives is gone forever. Now we're just living out our
lives. My debt to you knows no bounds. You found Baby for me.''

``It's you who found him,'' Gidal wishes to correct her. ``You told me to read
all the newspapers carefully, watch television day in and day out.
Listen to the radio day in and day out.''



\chapter{}

The hairdresser fans Shisha's hair dry and then puts the finishing touches to her hairdo. She asks, ``How
do you like it?''

``Thank you so much,'' Shisha responds mechanically, her eyes dull ~when she looks at herself
in the mirror.

The hairdresser's heart goes out to her. She prays for her recovery. Looking at the mass of vases overflowing with
flowers that fill the room she says, ``You're the loveliest flower here. And look at all these
gifts!''  She points to the pile of packages in the corner. Shisha looks away. She's unable to bring
herself to undo the satin ribbons and open the glossy wrappings. She knows she should do it, find out who sent them,
respond with~appropriate thank you notes. The same goes for the bouquets of flowers. But she's not up to it.
She's not up to anything.

The hairdresser lets a lock of hair fall delicately on Shisha's forehead. The young woman is impassive. The hairdresser
moves the lock of hair a bit to the side to conceal the temple. The young woman is
impassive.{ }``In the papers it says you should be awarded the
medal of courage ---'' the hairdresser chatters away.

``I wish they'd just let me be,'' says Shisha{.}

While the hairdresser sprays the fresh hairdo Shisha doesn't protect{ }her
eyes. The hairdresser does that for her. She then removes the smock from Shisha's shoulders and then touches up the new
curls with her fingertips. ``You are a beauty,'' she surveys her fondly. Shisha is silent.
She asks, ``Everyone wants to know when you'll~go to see the baby ---''

Shisha doesn't answer. She gets up from the chair and hobbles back to bed.

``Let me help you,'' the hairdresser offers.

``Thank you,'' Shisha says softly. ``I've learned to get into bed by
myself.'' She sinks back into the pillows and covers herself with a light blanket. ``Is he
still in the nursery?''

``He still is. Do you think you'll go and visit him?''

``If the doctor agrees. I'll get him the biggest teddy bear ever.'' The hairdresser now has an
answer for the press photographer who lives on the floor above her. Since learning of her weekly visits to the hospital
to give a hairdo plus manicure to one of the only two survivors of the explosion that wrecked the TV building, killing
over a hundred civilians and soldiers, he keeps badgering her with his request to discover if and when she goes to
visit the baby~she saved --- the other survivor.
Always on the lookout for a scoop, he wants to be the first to
immortalize their dramatic reunion. In return he has promised her to photograph her daughter's wedding gratis.

``What about the~manicure?'' the hairdresser asks Shisha. ``Or have you had
enough for one day?''

``How would I~know?'' Shisha says despondently. ``I only know that I simply
forgot all about the manicure.''

``I'll get organized and you can rest meanwhile.''

Shisha shuts her eyes. What was it that made her grab the handle of that carriage? Why did she wheel it out as far as
the supermarket in the new mall? These two questions give her no peace.

Meantime the hairdresser has packed the hairdressing kit~in one bag and has taken out the manicure tools from another.
She lays them out on a small folding table provided by the hospital whenever she comes to Shisha. She then places two
straight-back chairs on either side of it. She glances at Shisha lying there in bed, eyes closed but not asleep.
``Are you up to it now?'' she asks softly.

``It's not a question of being up to it or not,'' Shisha says, gathering strength to get
herself off the bed and sit opposite the hairdresser. Robot-like she extends her hands.

Beginning~to file Shisha's nails the hairdresser hopes that Shisha will initiate a conversation. This, as usual,
doesn't happen. ``I read in the papers that the Ministry of Defense has done your place up,''
she eventually remarks.

``I can't read,'' says Shisha. ``That too is gone along with my
memory.''

``It'll come back,'' the hairdresser assures her. ``Who didn't come to visit you!
They had to put a traffic cop in the corridor. People who were toddlers in kindergarten with you, classmates from
school, whoever knew you from wherever. Not to speak of VIP's, big brass, celebs. What color nail-polish would you
like? ''

``I'd{ }prefer none,'' Shisha says,
``but for the psychiatrist's sake let's opt for red. She keeps telling me that the best thing for me is to
return to my normal life as soon as possible{\ldots}As if I know what that was ---''

The hairdresser notices that Shisha's right wrist is still swollen. Word is that --- luckily for her --- the air blast from
the explosion threw her onto the baby's carriage. The metal rod jutting out of the corner of the supermarket scraped
her right temple only superficially. Another millimeter and she'd have been killed. She's heard that the doctors feel
it's too early to share this with the patient.

There's a light tap on the door. Doctor Nam enters, ``Good morning, ladies ---'' he greets the
two women with a pleasant smile.

The hairdresser and Shisha respond in unison, ``Good morning, Doctor Nam.''

``Am I intruding?''

``You never are, doctor,'' the hairdresser releases Shisha's hand.

``Please carry on,'' Doctor Nam tells her, ``I only dropped in for a moment.
Shisha, may I congratulate you on your lovely new~hairstyle.'' He lifts the lock of hair covering her
right temple. ``Excellent. The scar is healing beautifully. ~In a few months there won't be any trace of
it.''

Shisha says, ``One thing that I remember is that my blouse was bloodstained \textit{before} I got that
bruise on my head and that horrible whack on my wrist.'' She knows she's said this a thousand times but
she still can't help repeating it. ``I just don't remember when or how.''

Doctor Nam too repeats what he's already said to her just as often, ``All the doctors agree with you that
there's no connection between the bloodstains~on your blouse and your fall.'' Leaning on the bedrail at
the foot of Shisha's bed he scans the medical report clipped on it. When done he says, ``Well, today
you're leaving us, our brave girl!''

``I'm not brave.''

``We'll miss you ---''

``What will I do at home?''

``You don't have to make any plans right now. Let time take care of things.''

The beautician blows lightly over Shisha's nails to dry the polish. ``Finito,''
she says and packs her tools.~``Bye-bye, dear, and be \hbox{well ---''}

``Thank you,'' Shisha says,~``and please do me a favor and help yourself to some
of the flowers.''

``That'll be a real good deed,'' Doctor Nam says and then adds, ``This room is
like a flower shop and so is the corridor outside. The whole hospital is enjoying the spillover.''

``Thank you,'' says the hairdresser. ``The bouquets are so nicely arranged in
here. I'll take one from the corridor outside. Be well, my dear ---''

``Why not~keep making our Shisha more beautiful than she naturally is when she's at home?''
the doctor suggests.

``Will that be possible?'' asks the hairdresser.

``I'll see to it,'' says Doctor Nam, making a mental note to ask his secretary to call the
Ministry of Defense Welfare Department. They'll be more than happy to cover any expense for the young woman who put her
life on the line for an anonymous baby.

The hairdresser kisses Shisha affectionately on both cheeks before leaving.

Shisha wants to return to her bed, but Doctor Nam lays his hands lightly on    her shoulders. ``Why not
stay sitting up a little longer, Shisha. Lying in bed all the time isn't so advisable.''  Pushing the
small folding table aside he sits down on the hairdresser's chair. ``All your papers are
ready.{~} Matron will come in an hour to accompany you outside. Somebody from the Ministry of Defense
Rehabilitation Department will drive you home. She'll go inside with you to check that all is in order there and make
arrangements for anything that you still feel necessary. You indeed look very well. And please come for a checkup in a
month's time.  But should any question arise earlier, any problem, even the smallest --- don't hesitate to come earlier
or~phone. You now take one a pill at night, right?'' He~takes another glance at Shisha's medical report.
``Let's say you continue like that for another week and then cut down to half a pill for a week. And then
you might do fine without it altogether. I think I've covered the ground, Shisha, but maybe you have a question? A few
questions?''

``No, Doctor Nam,'' Shisha says. ``I mean, yes.''

Doctor Nam smiles, ``What's on your mind?''

``Those nightmares. Are they going to stay? Will they ever go away?''

Doctor Nam says, ``The best thing --- as the psychiatrist has suggested --- is to wake up completely. Get out
of bed. Take a sip of something,{ }whatever you like, maybe watch some
television. In time they'll go away.''

``Doctor Nam, I feel the handle of the carriage in my hands. But why on earth am I holding on to
it?''

Up to now Doctor Nam would respond to this repeated question with the words, `The day will come when you'll know.'
Feeling that even though Shisha's intelligence is not above average she's still able to grasp complex phenomena if
explained to her in plain clear language, today he says something else, ``Shisha dear, throughout your
hospitalization the police and the army wanted you to be treated by hypnosis so that you'd recall what had happened.
But the psychiatrist objected all along. And I've sided with her. We felt that it was like an unnecessary operation.
And since you were our patient, we had the say. But now, my dear, once you're home, if they repeat this suggestion it
will be up to you to decide.''

``So what should I tell them?''

``Both the psychiatrist and I still believe that the best thing is to let nature take its course. Not to
force memory. That it's better to let it renew itself in its own time, at its own pace. How are your nails doing? Has
the~varnish dried yet?''

``Almost, Doctor Nam.''

``Let me not spoil it.'' Cautiously he pats the back of Shisha's hand. ``You're a
brave young woman.''

``I wish they'd stop saying that. I don't remember what happened. But I know that I couldn't have been
brave. I've always been such a big coward.''

``So, see you in a month's time, my cowardly young woman.'' On his way to the door Doctor
Nam thinks about the young man who has phoned him several times to ask whether it would be alright if he visited
Shisha, being acquainted with her when she had sat at the information desk of the television building while he had
conducted tour-guides there. Though Doctor Nam was favorably impressed by the young man, he didn't think Shisha was
ready yet for this kind of visit. When he calls again, Doctor Nam now decides, he'll tell him that Shisha is now out of
hospital and back home. Yes, let whatever happens between the two of them happen on Shisha's turf. Doctor Nam closes
the door behind him with a good feeling.

\chapter{}

Zakod pulls out from under the stairs the two suitcases that Rimat and Glin brought with them when they first arrived.
He takes Glin's to the boy's room and opens it on his bed. He collects Glin's clothes and other effects from around the
room and packs them in the suitcase. He is careful not to touch the dog-tag and the three~photos sent by the army. Dela
had~asked permission to keep them.
He does not know what he do with them otherwise.
He scrutinizes the three
photos again. The same group of soldiers are photographed from three different angles, but none of their faces look
like Glin's. Could the crew cut and the uniform have changed him that much?  To his way of thinking, as he told
Dela, Glin does not appear in any of the photos because he was the photographer. She thinks otherwise. She's sure Glin
doesn't appear in any of them because it was not his style.  One thing they do agree on is that Glin's musical gear
was not returned because somebody at his base had taken a fancy to it.

Leaving Glin's room, he picks up Rimat's suitcase and places it on her bed in the adjoining one. Taking care of Rimat's
clothes and belongings is far more difficult for him. He braces himself, functions like a robot. Handling
her embroidery he finds the needle pinned into an almost completed flower. It feels like~touching Rimat's hand. He is
on the verge of tears{.}  If Dela could embroider, he believes, she might
have wished to continue where Rimat left off. After a moment of contemplation he puts the skein
of embroidery  threads together with the thimble and scissors in the middle of the fabric, rolls it up and lays it
inside the suitcase. He then takes the two packed suitcases and puts them back under the stairs. The lady who runs
``Hand to Hand''~has promised him on the phone to send a volunteer to pick them up as soon as
possible.

Returning to Rimat's room he takes a long look at Saffia's violin case lying on the top shelf of the bookcase. Not for
all{ }the whole world will he ever let it out of his hands. He reaches up and
pats the case. The cover sheds a handful of flakes at his touch as though in live response. Upstairs he has a ceramic
container in which he deposits these flakes. He cannot just throw them away.

He turns around, sits at the table, places a sheet of paper in front of him and writes:

\begin{quotation}
Dear Michlor,

Thank you for your letter.

My wife and I are by no means well-to-do. Still, our economic situation enables us to raise the baby we have adopted.
This is the reason why we are returning to you the generous check you sent us. Please accept it as our contribution to
the International Child Welfare Fund that you established.

As for your questions, I cannot begin to tell you about ourselves in detail. If you come for a visit we will have a lot
of ground to cover.

Let me explain how the adoption of the baby came about.  After it was ascertained that according to all external signs
and marks he might be~of~Balad origin, no qualified couple was willing to adopt him. You might be able to surmise the
reasons for it. This is why the authorities agreed to give him for adoption to us --- a couple evidently past the prime
of life, the adopting mother also an invalid.

This baby is a balm to our bereaved life.

We received your letter of condolence after our tragedy. My wife and I deeply appreciated your words. My wife did not
respond to you because she was so badly injured. I did not respond to you because I could not summon the mental and
emotional efforts it required.

Your letter reminded me of our days of old which hold deep meaning for me.

I wish you contentment in your life's work. You are most fortunate. You are one of the few in the world whose profession
is also their dedication to life.

Again, I wish to express to you the joint gratitude of my wife and myself.

Yours, in friendship,
\end{quotation}

Zakod goes over the letter, deleting a comma here, adding a full stop there. He then signs his name, folds the letter,
inserts it into an envelope, affixes a stamp at the top right-hand corner, writes on it the necessary details and puts it
aside.

That done, he takes another sheet of paper and begins to write:

\begin{quotation}
My very dear and old friend Gidal,

What you wrote is correct. Each of us mourns Rimat and Glin in his own way.

I will now address myself to your question. ~Since my television set was not in order that night I could not watch that
ceremony on it. Therefore, I cannot say anything about the looks of the young Balad who mounted the podium and
grabbed the microphone. Be that as it may, I can imagine to myself that some of the people in your village tend to jump
to the conclusion~that it was none other than Glin because --- according to your own words --- they ``so
much hated and detested Glin for his refusal to be conscripted.'' And this despite the fact that they only
saw him very briefly, since the broadcast (as I understood from the papers) was almost immediately blacked out after
his appearance. Added to this is~the fact that Glin's name appeared in the list of casualties among the soldiers. This
too might play tricks with the ability to think rationally. From my vast and deep study of history I learned that
wholesale animosity can easily serve as fertile ground for turning mere conjecture into hard and fast facts; and that
people tend to transpose~facts from one realm to another when in need of a basis for~their animosity.

Your letter reminded me of our days of old which hold deep meaning for me.

In friendship,
\end{quotation}

Baby's babblings begin to be heard upstairs.

Zakod leaves the letter. Later he~will go over it and prepare it for mailing. He climbs upstairs.



\chapter{}

The heater chimes. Zakod takes out Baby's feeding bottle.

Dela --- who'd rather~risk being accused of over-nagging than jeopardize Baby's welfare --- gently advises,
``Baby should have the vitamins before his bottle ---''

Where Baby's care is concerned Zakod accepts her opinion without question. He takes the small bottle of vitamin drops
from the refrigerator, places it in her hand and then bends over the carriage. ``Pardon me, young man,
for interrupting your eloquent speech,'' he picks up the infant, ``but here's where you need to
be.'' He deposits Baby in Dela's arms. Baby opens his fledgling-like mouth and Dela pops in the drops.
Baby smacks his lips. Zakod replaces the vitamin dispenser in Dela's hand with the feeding bottle.

Baby's lips tighten around the nipple. He sucks on it gustily. Dela imagines milk streaming from her breast.  If only
she could share this exhilarating sensation with somebody --- but with whom? Certainly not Zakod. Her inability to share
this kind of physical intimacy with him is an ache never to be relieved. It has been like that from the very
beginning. Sometimes she thinks she's made peace with it and all too soon realizes she hasn't. That's on a deep level
of life. On a shallow level, she doesn't like that old T-shirt of his that Zakod's found to replace Baby's bed
sheet printed with those lovely pale blue flowers --- the same print as his quilt cover and the carriage's mattress
cover. When Baby was brought to them she was so taken by those three items. No question that they have to be laundered
from time to time. But it's already three days that they've been hanging outside on the wash line. They must have
surely dried by now. Yet she wouldn't remind Zakod to take them down. He's overburdened beyond measure. Taking care
of Baby is in addition to all the other household and farm chores he shoulders. To say that none of them comes naturally to
him is a colossal understatement. Hopefully the delicate pale blue flowers won't fade in the~sun. ``Baby
has filled out,'' she smiles at Zakod, ``he's coming along very nicely.''

``Very nicely indeed,'' Zakod agrees, allowing himself to be carried away with sheer joy.

Once again Zakod's words assure Dela that he doesn't regret the adoption she so craved for in spite of the extra burden
that it places on him. ``Did you manage to do the packing?'' she asks,

``I did.''

``When are they coming to pick up the stuff?''

``The lady at their office said the moment they have someone to come for it. I decided not to give them the
violin. I want to keep it.''

Dela's heart is at ease. True, whatever has to do with Rimat is Zakod's domain, but she got so attached to her and to
Glin. The memory of Rimat's true love, Glin's father, playing that fiddle has become hers too.

Both of them now look at Baby, each aware of what the other~is thinking --- maybe he'll take up the violin when he grows
up. Eyes closed, at peace with the world, the little one has almost emptied the bottle.

``Not just yet,'' Dela says softly as Zakod gets up from his chair to take Baby from her.
Sitting down again he gazes at this divine picture~of a sleepy baby~nestling in a motherly bosom. He does not remember
any of the three girls in this way. At that point in time he was mainly waiting for them to grow older so that he
could discuss with them ideas and theories and historical events. Returning abruptly to the here and now he says,
``I wrote a letter to the man who sent us that generous check and explained why we are returning it,
telling him that this is our contribution to the International Child Welfare Fund that he set up --- the fund I told you
about. ~I also wrote a letter to the man in that village that Rimat and Glin came from.''

Dela is pleased to hear this. ``I wish our lovely~Shisha would come to understand that Baby has enough toys already,''
she says,
``and that she can come to visit without bringing him any more.''

Both of them glance at the collection of toys around the place --- the gigantic teddy-bear expropriating a substantial
part of the couch, the mobile swan hanging in the middle of the kitchen, the three~big balls on the carpet, the row of
raggedy Annes and raggedy Bobs filling up the bookcase in the living room.

Dela says, ``I don't know how to bring up the subject with her ---''

``Neither do I,'' Zakod agrees with her.

``Without a memory she's not a real person ---''

``The very thought that her memory might never return ---'' Zakod says realizing as he says it
that he cannot remember ever having had such a conversation with Dela.

``I did try to encourage her,'' Dela says, ``tell her that one day she'll have a
baby of her own. But who knows{\ldots}I feel that she can't even stand somebody mentioning that the scar on her face has
almost disappeared.''

Baby's lips slip off the bottle with a sneeze. He half-opens one eye and yawns.

``Like a full-fledged grown up,'' Zakod smiles.

``How I wish we had some photos of Rimat and Glin,'' Dela sighs.

``I will add that to the letter that I wrote to that man in the village. If he has any, maybe he will not
mind sending us a few.''

``I hope so ---'' says Dela, her eyes welling up.
``You may take Baby now~---''

Zakod first takes the bottle from her and stands it on the kitchen counter and then picks up Baby. ``I
will do him the honor of changing his diaper,'' he offers chivalrously.

``Good idea,'' says Dela. ``Even if he wakes up, he'll go back to sleep with a
bit of rocking.''

Zakod lays sleepy Baby on the chest of drawers between the kitchen and the living room --- a piece of furniture purchased
in preparation~for the adoption.

Now that he's standing with his back to her Dela ventures to ask, ``Was Rimat{\ldots}expecting~---?''

``No,'' replies Zakod as he fastens a fresh diaper around the chubby little body. He is
visibly moved by Dela's courage to ask this question.

There's a knock at the door.

``That must be Hand to Hand.'' Zakod says. He lays Baby inside the carriage  and opens the door. He
guessed wrong. A middle aged woman clad in black stands outside.
``Good morning, madam,'' he says, wondering whether she might be a Balad.

``Good morning, sir,'' says Mother.

Her accent leaves no room for doubt. ``Can I help you?'' he asks.

``I'm looking for housework,'' Mother says. ``Any housework ---''

``Please come in,'' Zakod shows her in.

Mother enters and follows Zakod to the kitchen. ``Good morning, madam,'' she addresses Dela.

``Good morning,  madam,'' Dela greets her.

``I'm looking for housework, any house work,'' says Mother again.  Baby starts to whimper.
She goes over to the~carriage and peers inside. Applying all the strength she can summon she smothers her emotions.
``He might be hungry,'' she says.

``He just had a full bottle,'' says Zakod,

``Perhaps he would like some dessert,'' Mother suggests.

Dela and Zakod exchange a look of mutual consent.

Zakod hands the bottle to Mother. She picks up Baby, sits down with him in her lap and gives him his bottle. Baby sucks
a bit, then less and less, then lets go altogether. He falls asleep. Mother says, ``He only needed a
little bit more to help him on his way to dreamland.''

Dela says, ``This is the baby who was found after the explosion in the television building. You may have
heard about it. No one came to claim him. And no one wanted to adopt him. They said he might be a Balad. That~doesn't
bother us. They agreed to let us adopt him even though we are no longer young --- as you can see for yourself --- and I{\ldots}'' She points to herself with a slight shrug.

``He's so very beautifully taken care of,'' says Mother. ``He looks healthy and
content.''

``We bought him a crib,'' says Zakod, ``but he prefers this carriage in which he
was found.''

``Babies love to be nestled closely,'' Mother says with feeling, ``like chicks in
a nest.''

Baby starts to whimper. Mother picks him up and rests him on her shoulder. ~He burps in his sleep. The three of them
chuckle.

``Doctor's orders,'' Dela comments warmly. ``His first tooth came out last
week.''

``And you didn't catch a wink all night long,'' Mother guesses and adds, ``Babies
like to tell the whole wide world about each new tooth.''

``We had three daughters ---'' Dela says. ``Their lives met with
disaster.''

``I weep with you with all my heart,'' Mother sympathizes earnestly. Gidal had told her about
that tragedy.

Dela asks, ``Do you have any children?''

``I had five children. Their lives met with disaster. My tears are welled up in my heart. What's the baby's
name?''

``We haven't decided on a name yet,'' Dela says. ``We call him `Baby' for the
time being. Would you like to stay with us and help~us?''

``I would,'' Mother assures these two good people. ``I can do everything. And
also take care of Baby.''

Zakod says, ``We have a spare unit downstairs.''

``I'm a Balad,'' says Mother her gaze lingering on Aera's hand-made pouch fixed on the front
of the carriage.

``I shall try and get you a permit,'' says Zakod following the Balad woman's eyes. He had
found in that pouch a faded photo of a man --- face puffy, hair uncombed, eyes unfocused. Every once in a while, when
alone, he looks at this photo. He so wants it to be his beloved friend Saffia's face that little by little it is.

Mother lays Baby back in the carriage. Once his sleep deepens she'll go outside to take down the laundry from the line.
Earlier, as she'd approached the house, pale blue flowers were fluttering there in the breeze.

Welcoming her.
